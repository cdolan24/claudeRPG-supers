# CORE RULES

## What You Need to Play

- **3-6 Players**: One Game Master (GM), 2-5 players
- **Dice**: Standard polyhedral set (d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, d20)
- **Character Sheets**: Provided in this guide
- **Pencils and Paper**: For notes and tracking

## Core Mechanic

**d20 + Modifier vs Target Number**

When you attempt something with a chance of failure, roll 1d20, add modifiers, and compare to a target number:
- **Attack Roll**: d20 + attack bonus vs AC (Armor Class)
- **Skill Check**: d20 + skill bonus vs DC (Difficulty Class)
- **Saving Throw**: d20 + save bonus vs DC

**Success**: Your roll meets or exceeds the target number  
**Failure**: Your roll is below the target number

## Advantage and Disadvantage

**Advantage**: Roll 2d20, use the higher result  
**Disadvantage**: Roll 2d20, use the lower result

These never stack. Multiple sources of advantage = one advantage.

## Difficulty Classes (DCs)

| DC | Difficulty |
|----|------------|
| 5 | Trivial |
| 10 | Easy |
| 15 | Moderate |
| 20 | Hard |
| 25 | Very Hard |
| 30 | Nearly Impossible |

## Proficiency Bonus

Your proficiency bonus increases as you level:

| Level | Proficiency Bonus |
|-------|-------------------|
| 1-4 | +2 |
| 5-8 | +3 |
| 9-12 | +4 |
| 13-16 | +5 |
| 17-20 | +6 |

Add your proficiency bonus to rolls you're proficient in (attacks with trained weapons, trained skills, class saving throws).

# CHARACTER CREATION

## Step-by-Step Process

### Step 1: Choose Power Level

Determine what tier of hero you're creating:

| Power Level | Starting Level | Character Points (CP) | Examples |
|-------------|----------------|----------------------|----------|
| **Street** | 1-4 | 100-150 CP | Daredevil, Punisher, Black Widow |
| **Superheroic** | 5-10 | 200-400 CP | Spider-Man, Iron Man, Captain America |
| **Cosmic** | 11-16 | 500-750 CP | Thor, Hulk, Silver Surfer |
| **Omega** | 17-20 | 1000+ CP | Phoenix, Galactus, reality warpers |

**Character Points per Level**: Gain 10 CP every level.

### Step 2: Choose Class

Pick one of 10 classes. Your class provides:
- **Hit Die** (determines HP)
- **Free Features** at each level (Second Wind, Extra Attack, etc.)
- **Proficiencies** (skills, saves, weapons, armor)
- **Suggested Build Path** (optional starting package)

**IMPORTANT**: Classes are guidelines, not prisons. You're free to spend your CP however you want.

**The 10 Classes**:
1. **Paragon** - Inspirational leader (Superman, Captain America)
2. **Juggernaut** - Unstoppable force (Hulk, Thing)
3. **Gadgeteer** - Tech genius (Iron Man, Batman)
4. **Mystic** - Spellcaster (Dr. Strange, Scarlet Witch)
5. **Martial Artist** - Peak human fighter (Daredevil, Black Widow)
6. **Speedster** - Super speed (Flash, Quicksilver)
7. **Metamorph** - Shapeshifter (Mystique, Beast Boy)
8. **Mentalist** - Psychic (Professor X, Jean Grey)
9. **Conduit** - Elemental channeler (Human Torch, Iceman)
10. **Trickster** - Deception specialist (Loki, Nightcrawler)

### Step 3: Ability Scores

**You have two pools for ability scores:**

**Pool 1: Point-Buy (27 points, scores 8-15)**

Use point-buy for ability scores 8-15:

| Score | Cost |
|-------|------|
| 8 | 0 points |
| 9 | 1 point |
| 10 | 2 points |
| 11 | 3 points |
| 12 | 4 points |
| 13 | 5 points |
| 14 | 7 points |
| 15 | 9 points |

**Pool 2: Character Points (scores 16+)**

To get scores above 15, spend Character Points:

**Enhanced [Ability] +1**: 10 CP per +1 (can purchase multiple times)

**Example**: To get STR 18:
1. Point-buy: 8 → 15 costs 9 points
2. CP: 15 → 16 costs 10 CP, 16 → 17 costs 10 CP, 17 → 18 costs 10 CP
3. **Total**: 9 point-buy + 30 CP = STR 18

**Ability Score Table**:

| Score | Modifier | Score | Modifier |
|-------|----------|-------|----------|
| 1 | -5 | 16-17 | +3 |
| 2-3 | -4 | 18-19 | +4 |
| 4-5 | -3 | 20-21 | +5 |
| 6-7 | -2 | 22-23 | +6 |
| 8-9 | -1 | 24-25 | +7 |
| 10-11 | +0 | 26-27 | +8 |
| 12-13 | +1 | 28-29 | +9 |
| 14-15 | +2 | 30 | +10 |

**The Six Abilities**:
- **Strength (STR)**: Physical power, melee attacks, carrying capacity
- **Dexterity (DEX)**: Agility, ranged attacks, AC, initiative
- **Constitution (CON)**: Toughness, hit points, stamina
- **Intelligence (INT)**: Logic, memory, knowledge, tech skills
- **Wisdom (WIS)**: Awareness, perception, insight, willpower
- **Charisma (CHA)**: Leadership, persuasion, force of personality

### Step 4: Calculate Hit Points

**Hit Points (HP)** = Hit Die + (CON modifier × 2) per level

**1st Level**: Maximum die result + (CON × 2)  
**Levels 2+**: Roll die result + (CON × 2) (or take average)

**Example**: Paragon (d12) with CON 16 (+3)
- **Level 1**: 12 + 6 = 18 HP
- **Level 2**: Roll 1d12 (got 7) + 6 = 13 HP, total 31 HP
- **Level 3**: Roll 1d12 (got 9) + 6 = 15 HP, total 46 HP

### Step 5: Spend Character Points

**You have three CP pools to spend**:

1. **Starting CP from power level** (100-1000 CP)
2. **CP from leveling** (+10 CP per level)
3. **CP from disadvantages** (gain CP by taking flaws)

**Spend CP on**:
- Advantages (powers, abilities, enhancements)
- Equipment (weapons, armor, gadgets)
- Additional ability score increases (16+)

**Optional Starting Package**: Each class suggests a thematic starting package you can take or ignore.

### Step 6: Choose Equipment

**Three options**:

**Option A**: Use class starting equipment table (pick a/b/c)  
**Option B**: Spend CP on equipment you choose  
**Option C**: Mix of both (take some suggested items, buy others)

**Equipment can be purchased with**:
- **CP**: Becomes "Signature Gear" (returns if lost)
- **Currency**: Mundane equipment (lost if destroyed)

### Step 7: Personality & Background

Define your character beyond mechanics:

**Background**: Where are you from? How did you get powers?

**Personality Traits**: Two traits that define how you act

**Ideals**: What do you believe in? What drives you?

**Bonds**: Who/what do you care about?

**Flaws**: What weaknesses do you have?

### Step 8: Final Details

- Choose name and appearance
- Select starting age
- Determine height and weight
- Choose alignment (optional)
- Write backstory
