## COMBAT TEST CASES

Running 5 test encounters to evaluate balance:

---

### TEST CASE 1: Street Level Hero vs Street Thugs
**Objective**: Test if street-level combat (100-150 CP) feels like D&D pace

**Hero**: "The Vigilante" - Street Level Martial Artist
- Level 2, 125 CP total
- STR 14 (+2), DEX 16 (+3), CON 13 (+1), INT 10, WIS 14 (+2), CHA 10
- HP: 22 (10 + 1 + 11), FP: 14
- AC: 16 (10 + 3 DEX + 3 DR from Kevlar)
- Combat Reflexes, Weapon Master (All), Enhanced Dodge +1
- Attack: Escrima sticks +5 to hit (DEX +3, Prof +2), 1d4+3 damage
- Active Defense: Dodge +3, Parry +2

**Enemies**: 4 Street Thugs
- AC 12 (leather jacket), HP 15 each
- Attack: +3 to hit, 1d6+1 damage (clubs)

**COMBAT SIMULATION**:

**Round 1**:
- Initiative: Vigilante 18, Thugs 11
- Vigilante attacks Thug 1: Rolls 14+5=19, hit! Damage: 3+3=6. Thug 1 HP: 15→9
- Vigilante bonus attack (Two-Weapon): Rolls 8+5=13, hit! Damage: 2+3=5. Thug 1 HP: 9→4
- Thug 1 attacks: Rolls 15+3=18, hit! Vigilante uses DODGE (+3), AC becomes 19, miss!
- Thug 2 attacks: Rolls 10+3=13, miss
- Thug 3 attacks: Rolls 16+3=19, hit! Damage: 4+1=5, Vigilante HP: 22→17
- Thug 4 attacks: Rolls 8+3=11, miss

**Round 2**:
- Vigilante attacks Thug 1: Rolls 19+5=24, hit! Damage: 4+3=7. Thug 1 HP: 4→0, DOWN!
- Vigilante bonus attack Thug 2: Rolls 11+5=16, hit! Damage: 3+3=6. Thug 2 HP: 15→9
- Thug 2 attacks: Rolls 7+3=10, miss
- Thug 3 attacks: Rolls 18+3=21, hit! Damage: 5+1=6, Vigilante HP: 17→11
- Thug 4 attacks: Rolls 12+3=15, miss

**Round 3**:
- Vigilante attacks Thug 2: Rolls 16+5=21, hit! Damage: 4+3=7. Thug 2 HP: 9→2
- Vigilante bonus attack Thug 2: Rolls 13+5=18, hit! Damage: 2+3=5. Thug 2 HP: 2→0, DOWN!
- Thug 3 attacks: Rolls 9+3=12, miss
- Thug 4 attacks: Rolls 14+3=17, hit! Damage: 3+1=4, Vigilante HP: 11→7

**Round 4**:
- Vigilante attacks Thug 3: Rolls 17+5=22, hit! Damage: 4+3=7. Thug 3 HP: 15→8
- Vigilante bonus attack Thug 3: Rolls 20+5=25, CRIT! Damage: (4+4)+3=11. Thug 3 HP: 8→0, DOWN!
- Thug 4 retreats (morale check failed)

**RESULT**: Victory in 4 rounds, hero at 7/22 HP

**ANALYSIS**:
✅ Combat length: 4 rounds is perfect D&D pacing
✅ Danger level: Hero took damage but never in serious danger
✅ Active Defense: Made 1 attack miss, felt impactful but not overpowered
⚠️ **ISSUE**: DR 3 only added +3 AC. Against 1d6+1 damage (avg 4.5), hero takes ~1.5 damage per hit after DR. This feels right but DR seems underwhelming since it also reduces damage

**RECOMMENDATION**: DR adding to AC AND reducing damage might be too strong at higher levels. Consider capping DR bonus to AC at +5 or +10?

---

### TEST CASE 2: Superheroic Hero vs Supervillain Minions
**Objective**: Test if superheroic combat (200-300 CP) stays D&D-paced

**Hero**: "Voltage" - Gadgeteer Level 3
- 250 CP total
- STR 10, DEX 16 (+3), CON 14 (+2), INT 18 (+4), WIS 12 (+1), CHA 13 (+1)
- HP: 26 (8+2, 5+2, 5+2), FP: 17
- AC: 20 (10 + 3 DEX + 5 DR from exosuit + 2 AC from exosuit)
- Innate Attack (Electricity) 3d6, +7 to hit (DEX +3, Prof +2, Specialized +2)
- Active Defense: Dodge +3

**Enemies**: 1 Super-Powered Lieutenant + 3 Combat Drones
- Lieutenant: AC 16, HP 60, +6 to hit, 2d8+3 damage (energy sword)
- Drones: AC 15, HP 20 each, +5 to hit, 1d8+2 laser damage

**COMBAT SIMULATION**:

**Round 1**:
- Initiative: Voltage 19, Lieutenant 14, Drones 10
- Voltage attacks Drone 1: Rolls 18+7=25, hit! Damage: 4+5+3=12. Drone 1 HP: 20→8
- Lieutenant attacks Voltage: Rolls 17+6=23, hit! Damage: 7+8+3=18, minus DR 5 = 13 damage! Voltage HP: 26→13
- Drone 1 attacks: Rolls 11+5=16, miss (AC 20)
- Drone 2 attacks: Rolls 19+5=24, hit! Damage: 6+2=8, minus DR 5 = 3 damage! Voltage HP: 13→10
- Drone 3 attacks: Rolls 8+5=13, miss

**Round 2**:
- Voltage uses Tactical Genius (bonus action): Grants Lieutenant -2 to next attack (player ally gets advantage, but solo here so gives disadvantage to enemy)
- Voltage attacks Lieutenant: Rolls 15+7=22, hit! Damage: 5+4+2=11. Lieutenant HP: 60→49
- Lieutenant attacks with disadvantage: Rolls 15/8+6=14, miss!
- Drone 1 attacks: Rolls 13+5=18, miss
- Drone 2 attacks: Rolls 16+5=21, hit! Damage: 5+2=7, minus DR 5 = 2 damage! Voltage HP: 10→8
- Drone 3 attacks: Rolls 9+5=14, miss

**Round 3**:
- Voltage attacks Drone 1: Rolls 19+7=26, hit! Damage: 3+3+6=12. Drone 1 HP: 8→0, DOWN!
- Lieutenant attacks: Rolls 18+6=24, hit! Voltage uses DODGE (+3), AC becomes 23, miss!
- Drone 2 attacks: Rolls 14+5=19, miss
- Drone 3 attacks: Rolls 20+5=25, CRIT! Damage: (8+8)+2=18, minus DR 5 = 13 damage! Voltage HP: 8→0, DOWN!

**RESULT**: Voltage defeated in 3 rounds

**ANALYSIS**:
❌ **MAJOR ISSUE**: DR 5 from exosuit made hero nearly invincible against drones (1d8+2 avg 6.5, reduced to 1.5 after DR) but Lieutenant's 2d8+3 (avg 12) still chunked hard
✅ Combat was fast-paced (3 rounds)
❌ **LETHALITY TOO HIGH**: Hero went from 26 HP to 0 HP in 3 rounds despite DR 5 and AC 20
⚠️ Critical hit dealt 18 damage before DR, 13 after—this is GURPS lethality, not D&D

**RECOMMENDATIONS**:
1. **Cap maximum damage from single attack** at 2× character level (Level 3 = max 6 damage from one hit)? Too restrictive
2. **Reduce critical hit damage**: Crits add +1 damage die (not double all dice)
3. **DR should reduce crits**: Critical hits should not bypass DR entirely
4. **Add "Bloodied" threshold**: At half HP, gain defensive benefit (+2 AC or resistance?)

**Objective**: Test new Conduit class balance

**Hero**: "Inferno" - Fire Conduit Level 5
- 300 CP total

- HP: 58 (10+4, then 6+4, 7+4, 5+4, 6+4), FP: 24
- AC: 17 (10 + 2 DEX + 5 DR from fire-resistant armor)

- Elemental Form: 2/short rest, +1d6 damage, leave fire trail
- Manifestations: Burning Aura, Flame Dash, Ignite

**Enemies**: 2 Ice Golems + 1 Fire-Resistant Knight
- Ice Golems: AC 14, HP 45 each, +6 to hit, 2d8+3 cold, vulnerable to fire (×2 damage)
- Knight: AC 18, HP 60, +7 to hit, 2d10+4, fire resistance (half damage)

**COMBAT SIMULATION**:

**Round 1**:
- Initiative: Inferno 16, Golems 12, Knight 10
- Inferno bonus action: Enter Elemental Form (spend 2 FP, FP: 24→22)
- Inferno attacks Ice Golem 1: Rolls 16+7=23, hit! Damage: (3+4+2+5+1)×2 (vulnerable) = 30 damage! Golem 1 HP: 45→15
- Inferno Extra Attack on Golem 1: Rolls 14+7=21, hit! Damage: (4+5+3+2+2)×2 = 32 damage! Golem 1 HP: 15→0, MELTED!
- Ice Golem 2 attacks: Rolls 15+6=21, hit! Damage: 9+7+3=19 cold... but Inferno has RESISTANCE to cold (half), takes 9 damage! HP: 58→49
- Knight attacks: Rolls 13+7=20, hit! Damage: 7+8+4=19. Inferno HP: 49→30

**Round 2**:
- Burning Aura activates: Knight takes 1d6=4 fire, resists to 2 damage. Knight HP: 60→58
- Inferno attacks Ice Golem 2: Rolls 18+7=25, hit! Damage: (5+4+3+6+1)×2 = 38 damage! Golem 2 HP: 45→7
- Inferno Extra Attack on Golem 2: Rolls 12+7=19, hit! Damage: (2+4+5+3+2)×2 = 32 damage! Golem 2 HP: 7→0, DESTROYED!
- Knight attacks: Rolls 19+7=26, hit! Damage: 10+9+4=23. Inferno HP: 30→7 (BLOODIED!)

**Round 3**:
- Burning Aura: Knight takes 5 fire, resists to 2. Knight HP: 58→56
- Inferno uses Flame Dash (bonus action): Teleport away 30 ft
- Inferno attacks Knight from range: Rolls 17+7=24, hit! Damage: (4+6+2+4+3)÷2 (resistance) = 9 damage. Knight HP: 56→47
- Knight moves and attacks: Rolls 11+7=18, miss (AC 17)

**Round 4**:
- Burning Aura: Knight takes 3, resists to 1. Knight HP: 47→46
- Inferno attacks Knight: Rolls 20+7=27, CRIT! Damage: (6+6+6+6+6+5)÷2 = 17 damage! Knight HP: 46→29
- Inferno Extra Attack: Rolls 16+7=23, hit! Damage: (5+4+3+2+1)÷2 = 7 damage. Knight HP: 29→22
- Knight attacks: Rolls 18+7=25, hit! Damage: 8+10+4=22. Inferno HP: 7→0, DOWN!

**RESULT**: Inferno defeated in 4 rounds after destroying 2 ice golems

**ANALYSIS**:
✅ Conduit felt POWERFUL against vulnerable enemies (ice golems melted instantly)
✅ Resistance mechanic worked well (cold damage halved)
❌ **VULNERABILITY IS DEVASTATING**: 2× damage means one good enemy turn = dead hero
⚠️ Knight with fire resistance was too tanky (dealt half damage)
✅ Elemental Form felt impactful (+1d6 is significant)
❌ **LETHALITY AGAIN**: Hero went from 58 HP to 0 in 4 hits (even with DR 5 + resistance)

**RECOMMENDATIONS**:
1. **Vulnerability should be ×1.5 damage, not ×2**
2. **Resistance should reduce to 2/3 damage, not 1/2** (feels better than current DR which is all-or-nothing)
3. **Conduits need higher HP** (d10 is good but CON needs to be primary stat)
4. **Elemental Form should grant temp HP** = CON × level when activated (Level 5 = 20 temp HP)

  - Construct 2 DEX save: Rolls 15+2=17, success! Takes 9 damage. HP: 50→41
  - Legion DEX save: Rolls 12+2=14, fail! Takes 18 damage minus DR 3 = 15. HP: 52→37

**Round 3**:
- Legion bonus action: Summon Enhancement on Construct 1 (+10 ft speed, move away)
- Legion attacks: Rolls 11+6=17, miss
- Construct 1 (hurt, moves back): Attacks from range... wait, construct has no ranged attack. Disengages instead.
- Construct 2 attacks: Rolls 20+10=30, CRIT! Damage: (8+8)+8+9=33. Robot HP: 114→81

  - Legion: Rolls 17+9=26, hit! Damage: 10+6+8+6=30 minus DR 3 = 27. Legion HP: 9→0, DOWN!

**RESULT**: Legion defeated in 5 rounds, robot at 26/200 HP

**ANALYSIS**:
✅ Summoner's action economy is STRONG (effectively 3-4 attacks per round)
❌ **SUMMONS TOO FRAGILE**: Robot one-shots them with multiattack
⚠️ Summoner relies entirely on summons—if they die, hero is useless
✅ Combat was engaging (5 rounds, back-and-forth)
❌ **LETHALITY**: Hero took 43 damage in 2 hits (even with DR 3)

**RECOMMENDATIONS**:
1. **Summons need more HP**: Current HP (50 base + 35 from level 7) isn't enough. Boss deals ~30 damage per hit.
2. **Give Summoner defensive features**: Maybe "Sacrifice Summon" reaction—when hit, summon takes damage instead?
3. **Summoner HP too low**: d8 HD is dangerous when enemies deal 30+ damage per hit
4. **Consider "Summon Shield" class feature**: When summoner would take damage, summon within 10 ft can intercept

### TEST CASE 5: Four Heroes vs Major Threat (Party Combat)
**Objective**: Test if party combat stays D&D-paced

**Heroes**:
1. **Paragon** (Level 5): HP 75, AC 18, +8 to hit, 2d6+5 damage, DR 7, Flight
2. **Mystic** (Level 5): HP 42, AC 14, Fireball (8d6), Magic Missile (3×1d4+1)

- Multiattack: 3 attacks
- AOE Roar: 40-ft radius, 6d6 thunder (CON save), recharge 5-6
- DR 10, Regeneration 15 HP/round

**COMBAT SIMULATION**:

**Round 1**:

**Round 2**:
- Paragon: Making death saves (rolls 14, success 1)
- Mystic uses Magic Missile on monster: 3 darts auto-hit, 1d4+1 each = 3+4+3 = 10 minus DR 10 = 3 total. Monster HP: 267→264
- Martial Artist uses Perfect Strike (maximize damage): Attacks monster
  - Rolls 18+9=27, hit! Damage: 8+5=13 minus DR 10 = 3. Monster HP: 264→261
  - Rolls 16+9=25, hit! Damage: 7+5=12 minus DR 10 = 2. Monster HP: 261→259
  - Rolls 13+9=22, hit! Damage: 5+5=10 minus DR 10 = 1. Monster HP: 259→258
- Speedster uses Velocity Strike (moved 60+ ft): 
  - Rolls 19+8=27, hit! Damage: (4+4)+3d6 (5+4+2)=19 minus DR 10 = 9. Monster HP: 258→249
  - Second attack: Rolls 11+8=19, hit! Damage: 3+4=7 minus DR 10 = 0 (min 1). Monster HP: 249→248
- Monster Regenerates: 15 HP. Monster HP: 248→263
- Monster uses AOE Roar! All heroes make CON saves:
  - Paragon (unconscious): Auto-fail, takes 6d6=24 damage. Death save fail! (Now 1 success, 1 failure)
  - Mystic: Rolls 10+1=11, fails! Takes 24 damage. HP: 42→18
  - Martial Artist: Rolls 14+2=16, success! Takes 12 damage. HP: 60→48
  - Speedster: Rolls 17+3=20, success! Takes 12 damage. HP: 50→38

**Round 3**:
- Paragon: Death save, rolls 8, fail (1 success, 2 failures)
- Mystic casts Haste on Martial Artist (spend 6 FP): +2 AC, double speed, extra action
- Martial Artist (Hasted, 6 attacks!): Focuses on dealing damage
  - All 6 attacks hit (assuming average rolls), dealing ~6 damage total after DR 10. Monster HP: 263→257
- Speedster attacks twice: Deals ~2 damage total. Monster HP: 257→255
- Monster Regenerates: 15 HP. Monster HP: 255→270
- Monster attacks Speedster (3 times, disadvantage from Blur):
  - Rolls 18/11+10=21, miss (AC 21)!
  - Rolls 16/14+10=24, hit! Damage: 7+9+8+6+8=38. Speedster HP: 38→0, DOWN!
  - Third attack targets Mystic: Rolls 17+10=27, hit! Damage: 10+7+8+9+8=42. Mystic HP: 18→0, DOWN!

  - Rolls 14+10=24, hit! Damage: 9+6+8+10+8=41. Martial Artist HP: 6→0, DOWN!
  - Third attack: (no targets in range)

**Round 5**: All heroes are down or making death saves.

**RESULT**: TPK (Total Party Kill) in 5 rounds, monster still at 279/300 HP

**ANALYSIS**:
❌ **CATASTROPHIC IMBALANCE**: DR 10 made party's damage trivial (most attacks dealt 1-5 damage after DR)
❌ **REGENERATION TOO STRONG**: 15 HP/round negated all party damage
❌ **DAMAGE OUTPUT TOO HIGH**: Monster dealt 30-40 damage per hit, one-shotting heroes
❌ **MULTIATTACK is DEADLY**: 3 attacks per round meant 3 heroes downed in 3 rounds
✅ Combat length was D&D-appropriate (would have been 5-7 rounds if balanced)

**CRITICAL PROBLEM IDENTIFIED**: 
- DR system creates "damage threshold" problem: attacks dealing less than DR are nearly useless
- High DR enemies require high damage to hurt, but high damage one-shots low-DR heroes
- This creates GURPS-style "rocket tag" (whoever hits first wins)

---

## IDENTIFIED WEAKNESSES IN CHARACTER CREATION

### 1. **DR SCALING IS BROKEN**
**Problem**: DR adds to AC AND reduces damage. At high levels (DR 10+), this makes characters nearly invincible against low-damage attacks but still vulnerable to high-damage attacks.

**Examples**:
- Martial Artist dealing 1d8+5 (avg 9.5) vs DR 10 enemy = 0-1 damage per hit
- Monster dealing 4d10+8 (avg 30) vs DR 7 hero = 23 damage per hit (still devastating)

**Fixes**:
- **Option A**: DR adds to AC but does NOT reduce damage after hit
- **Option B**: DR reduces damage but does NOT add to AC
- **Option C**: Cap DR bonus to AC at +5, but full DR applies to damage reduction
- **Option D** (RECOMMENDED): Use D&D's damage resistance system instead
  - No DR stat
  - Instead, resistances reduce damage by 50% (round down)
  - Immunities reduce by 100%
  - This is much simpler and avoids threshold problems

### 2. **DAMAGE SCALING TOO HIGH**
**Problem**: Damage dice scale faster than HP. A Level 5 character has ~50 HP but enemies deal 30-40 damage per hit.

**Examples**:
- Level 5 Paragon: 75 HP, but kaiju deals 38-42 per hit = 2-shot kill
- Level 3 Gadgeteer: 26 HP, Lieutenant deals 18 per hit (before DR) = 2-shot kill

**Fixes**:
- **Reduce damage dice**: Use 1d6/1d8 instead of 2d8/3d10 for most attacks
- **Increase HP scaling**: Give +CON modifier × 2 per level instead of ×1
- **Add "Heroic Resilience"**: When reduced below half HP, gain resistance to next attack
- **Cap single-instance damage** at 3× character level (Level 5 = max 15 damage from one hit)?

### 3. **CRITICAL HITS TOO LETHAL**
**Problem**: Doubling ALL dice (D&D 5e style) creates massive damage spikes in a system where HP is already tight.

**Example**:
- Normal hit: 2d8+3 = ~12 damage
- Critical hit: 4d8+3 = ~21 damage (almost double)
- Against hero with 30 HP, this is 70% of health in one hit

**Fixes**:
- **Reduce crit damage**: Add ONE extra damage die (not double all dice)
  - Normal: 2d8+3, Crit: 3d8+3
- **DR applies fully to crits**: Don't let crits bypass DR
- **"Glancing Blow" rule**: If crit would reduce hero to 0 HP, they're left at 1 HP instead (once per long rest)

### 4. **ACTIVE DEFENSE WEAK**
**Problem**: Active Defense adds ability modifier (+2 to +5), but enemies still hit 60-70% of the time.

**Example**:
- Hero AC 16, uses Dodge (+3) = AC 19
- Enemy +8 to hit needs 11+ (50% chance)
- Without Dodge, needed 8+ (65% chance)
- Dodge reduced hit chance by 15%—good but not game-changing

**Fixes**:
- **Increase Active Defense bonus**: Add ability modifier + proficiency bonus
  - Level 5 Dodge: +3 DEX +3 Prof = +6 AC (much more impactful)
- **Active Defender advantage is too expensive**: 15 CP per level should be 10 CP
- **Add "Total Defense" action**: Spend action, gain +5 AC until next turn (like D&D's Dodge action)

### 5. **ELEMENTAL WEAKNESSES TOO PUNISHING**
**Problem**: Taking ×2 damage from opposing element means instant death.

**Example**:
- Fire Conduit with 58 HP
- Ice Golem crits with cold attack: 19 cold × 2 vulnerability = 38 damage
- One crit = 65% of HP gone

**Fixes**:
- **Reduce vulnerability multiplier**: ×1.5 instead of ×2
- **Give Conduits higher HP**: d12 HD instead of d10
- **Elemental Form grants temp HP**: Equal to CON score when activated

### 6. **SUMMONS DON'T SCALE WELL**
**Problem**: Summons have fixed HP that don't scale with combat difficulty.

**Example**:
- Level 7 Summoner: Battle Construct has 85 HP
- Boss deals 30 damage per hit = 3-shot kill
- Summon lasts less than 2 rounds

**Fixes**:
- **Scale summon HP with level**: Base HP + (Summoner level × 10)
  - Level 7 Construct: 50 + 70 = 120 HP
- **Give summons DR**: Equal to half Summoner's level (Level 7 = DR 3)
- **Add "Summon Resilience" feature**: Summons have resistance to all damage

### 7. **ABILITY SCORE COSTS INCONSISTENT**
**Problem**: Going from 15 to 16 costs 10 CP, but going from 10 to 15 only costs 9 points in point-buy (27 point system).

**Example**:
- Standard array: 15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8 (costs 27 points in point-buy)
- But buying 16 costs 10 CP
- This creates confusion: which system applies when?

**Fixes**:
- **Separate systems clearly**: 
  - Point-buy is for NORMAL range (8-15)
  - Character Points are for SUPERHUMAN range (16+)
- **Add table showing both costs** side-by-side
- **Example**: "STR 16 costs 10 CP beyond base (15 from point-buy + 10 CP = 16 STR total)"

### 8. **FP COSTS UNCLEAR FOR POWERS**
**Problem**: Some powers say "spend X FP" but it's unclear how much. Spell list shows FP costs, but not innate attacks.

**Example**:
- Fire Conduit's "Elemental Form" costs 2 FP
- But "Phoenix Rebirth" doesn't list FP cost
- Spells have clear costs (Fireball = 6 FP), but class abilities don't

**Fixes**:
- **Standardize FP costs**: 
  - Minor abilities: 1-2 FP
  - Standard abilities: 3-5 FP
  - Major abilities: 6-10 FP
  - Ultimate abilities: 10-15 FP
- **Add FP cost to EVERY class feature** that should cost FP
- **List FP costs in class feature descriptions**

### 9. **NO HEALING IN COMBAT**
**Problem**: Once HP is lost, it stays lost unless Mystic burns spell slots. No "healing surge" or "second wind" baseline.

**Example**:
- Party takes 100 damage in Round 1
- No way to recover unless Mystic has healing spells
- D&D has healing potions, Lay on Hands, Healing Word, etc.

**Fixes**:
- **Add "Heroic Recovery" universal feature**: Bonus action, spend Hit Die + CON modifier to heal (like D&D short rest), usable in combat once per short rest
- **Add healing potions to equipment list**: 
  - Minor potion: 2d4+2 HP, 50 CP
  - Standard potion: 4d4+4 HP, 150 CP
  - Greater potion: 8d4+8 HP, 500 CP
- **Some classes should get healing**: 
  - Paragon: Second Wind (already has this, good!)
  - Water Conduit: Healing Waters
  - Nature Conduit: Regeneration
  - Add "Healer" feat for 15 CP

### 10. **EXOSUITS TOO EXPENSIVE**
**Problem**: Exosuit base is 500 CP. At superheroic level (250 CP total), you can't afford an exosuit without giving up ALL other advantages.

**Example**:
- Iron Man equivalent needs:
  - Exosuit Base: 500 CP
  - Flight: 500 CP
  - Repulsors: 300 CP
  - Total: 1300 CP
- But superheroic level is only 250 CP!

**Fixes**:
- **Reduce exosuit base cost**: 250 CP (half current cost)
- **Or make exosuit "built-in" to Gadgeteer class**: 
  - Gadgeteer Level 1 feature: "Battlesuit"—You have an exosuit (base model) at no CP cost. You can spend CP to enhance it.
- **Give "Signature Gear" advantage**: For 50 CP, get 500 CP worth of equipment (including exosuits)

---

## FINAL RECOMMENDATIONS FOR BALANCE

### IMMEDIATE FIXES (HIGH PRIORITY)

1. **Replace DR System with D&D Resistance**:
   - Remove "DR adds to AC"
   - Remove "DR reduces damage after hit"
   - Replace with: "Resistance = half damage (round down), Immunity = no damage"
   - Armor gives AC bonus only
   - Powers give resistance/immunity to specific damage types

2. **Reduce Damage Scaling**:
   - Weapon/attack damage: Use 1d6, 1d8, 2d6 max at low/mid levels
   - Only at high level (15+) should attacks deal 3d8 or higher
   - Reduce monster/enemy damage by 30-40%

3. **Modify Critical Hits**:
   - Crits add ONE extra damage die (not double all dice)
   - Example: 2d8+3 → 3d8+3 on crit (not 4d8+3)

4. **Buff Active Defense**:
   - Active Defense adds ability modifier + proficiency bonus
   - Example: Level 5 Dodge = +3 DEX +3 Prof = +6 AC (meaningful!)

5. **Add Healing Options**:
   - Universal "Heroic Recovery" feature (bonus action, spend HD in combat, 1/short rest)
   - Add healing potions to equipment
   - Water Conduit gets healing
   - Nature Conduit gets regeneration

### MEDIUM PRIORITY

6. **Rebalance Vulnerability**:
   - Vulnerability = ×1.5 damage (not ×2)
   - Give vulnerable characters compensating HP boost

7. **Buff Summons**:
   - Summon HP = Base + (Level × 10)
   - Summons gain DR = Level ÷ 2

8. **Fix Exosuit Costs**:
   - Reduce base cost to 250 CP
   - Or give Gadgeteer free exosuit at Level 1

9. **Clarify FP Costs**:
   - Add FP cost to every class feature
   - Standardize: Minor (1-2), Standard (3-5), Major (6-10), Ultimate (10+)

10. **Fix Ability Score Confusion**:
    - Add clear table showing point-buy (8-15) vs CP costs (16+)
    - Example: "To get STR 18: Use point-buy to get 15 (9 pts), then spend 20 CP to reach 18"

---

## CONCLUSION

### What Works Well:
✅ Class variety is excellent
✅ Combat length is D&D-appropriate (3-5 rounds)
✅ Action economy is engaging
✅ Character customization is deep
✅ New classes (Conduit, Summoner) are flavorful

### What Needs Fixing:
❌ DR system creates "damage threshold" problems → Switch to D&D resistance
❌ Damage too high, HP too low → Reduce damage, increase HP
❌ Crits too lethal → Reduce crit damage
❌ No in-combat healing → Add Heroic Recovery + potions
❌ Active Defense too weak → Buff to include proficiency
❌ Exosuits too expensive → Reduce cost by half
❌ Summons too fragile → Scale HP with level

### Testing Verdict:
**Current system is 70% of the way to D&D pacing but has GURPS lethality problems.** The DR system is the #1 culprit. Switching to D&D-style resistance will fix most issues.

Would you like me to create a v2.2 with these fixes implemented, or would you prefer to review the recommendations first and tell me which fixes to prioritize?
