## DEFENSE SYSTEM (REVISED)

### Innate Armor Class (AC)
**Formula**: **10 + DEX modifier + DR + Armor AC bonus**

**Components**:
- **Base**: 10 (everyone starts here)
- **DEX modifier**: Your Dexterity bonus
- **DR (Damage Resistance)**: Full DR value, NOT divided by 5 (CHANGED)
- **Armor AC**: Bonus from worn armor (see Armor Table)

**Example**: Character with DEX 14 (+2), DR 3, wearing Bulletproof Vest (AC +1)
- AC = 10 + 2 + 3 + 1 = **16**

### Psionic Armor Class
**Formula**: **WIS score + Mind Shield bonus + Psionic Armor bonus**

**Note**: Uses full Wisdom SCORE, not modifier!

**Components**:
- **WIS score**: Your full Wisdom ability score (10-20+)
- **Mind Shield advantage**: +2 to +5 (must have advantage to use reaction)
- **Psionic Armor advantage**: +2 to +10 (passive mental defense)

**Example**: Character with WIS 16, Mind Shield +3, Psionic Armor +4
- Psionic AC = 16 + 3 + 4 = **23**

### Damage Resistance (DR)
**How DR Works**:
- DR now adds DIRECTLY to AC (no division)
- DR also reduces damage after a hit
- Example: DR 5 means +5 AC and -5 damage from all hits

**Sources of DR**:
- Advantages (Damage Resistance, Tough Skin, etc.)
- Armor
- Powers (Force fields, stone skin, etc.)
- Temporary effects (spells, abilities)

---

## ACTIVE DEFENSE (REVISED)

**As a Reaction**, you can add your ability modifier to AC against ONE attack you can see/sense.

### Standard Active Defenses

**Dodge** (DEX-based)
- Add your DEX modifier to AC vs one attack
- Example: DEX 16 (+3) = +3 AC against that attack
- Requirements: Can see attack, not restrained

**Parry** (STR-based)
- Add your STR modifier to AC vs one melee attack
- Example: STR 18 (+4) = +4 AC against that attack
- Requirements: Wielding melee weapon or unarmed combat ready

**Block** (CON-based)
- Add your CON modifier to AC vs one attack
- Example: CON 14 (+2) = +2 AC against that attack
- Requirements: Must have shield or defensive item

**Mind Shield** (WIS-based)
- Add your WIS modifier to Psionic AC vs one mental attack
- Example: WIS 16 (+3) = +3 Psionic AC against that attack
- Requirements: Must have Mind Shield advantage

### Example Combat
Character has AC 15, DEX +5

Three ninjas attack:
- Ninja 1 rolls 13 → Misses (vs AC 15)
- Ninja 2 rolls 17 → Character uses DODGE reaction (+5) → New AC 20 → Misses!
- Ninja 3 rolls 16 → Hits (vs AC 15)

### New Advantages Related to Active Defense

**Active Defender** [15 CP per level, max 3 levels]
- Can use Active Defense reactions multiple times per round
- Level 1: Block 2 attacks per round
- Level 2: Block 3 attacks per round
- Level 3: Block 4 attacks per round
- Note: Still only ONE reaction per trigger, but can use reaction more than once

**Enhanced Active Defense** [10 CP per +1, max +5]
- When using Active Defense, add additional +1 to +5 beyond ability modifier
- Stacks with ability modifier
- Example: DEX +3, Enhanced Active Defense +2 = total +5 to AC when dodging

### New Disadvantage

**Passive Combatant** [-15 CP]
- Cannot use Active Defense reactions
- Can still use normal reactions (opportunity attacks, etc.)
- Represents lack of combat training or mental block

---

## OFFENSE SYSTEM

### Basic Strike (Physical)
**Formula**: **((STR + DEX) ÷ 4) + Proficiency Bonus** (if proficient in unarmed combat)
- Minimum damage: 1 + STR modifier
- This is your baseline melee/unarmed attack

### Mental Kick (Psionic)
**Formula**: **((INT + WIS) ÷ 6) + Proficiency Bonus** (if proficient in psionics)
- Damage: 1d6 + INT or WIS modifier (your choice)
- This is your baseline mental attack

**Special**: Mystics and Mentalists use **((INT + WIS) ÷ 4)** instead of ÷6

### Weapon Attacks
**Formula**: **d20 + Proficiency Bonus + ability modifier + Specialized Skill bonus**
- Melee: Usually STR
- Ranged: Usually DEX
- Finesse: Choose STR or DEX

### Innate Attacks (Powers)
**Formula**: **d20 + Proficiency Bonus + ability modifier + Specialized Skill: Innate Attack (Type)**
- Fire blast, ice beam, energy projection, etc.
- Damage determined by advantage level purchased
- Can improve attack roll with Specialized Skill
- To improve damage, spend more CP on the advantage itself
