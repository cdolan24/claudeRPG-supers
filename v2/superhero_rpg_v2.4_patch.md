# SUPERHERO RPG v2.4 PATCH NOTES
## Class-Locked Abilities, Multiclassing, & Remaining Subclasses

---

## CORE PHILOSOPHY: "BUILD ANYTHING" WITH BOUNDARIES

**Goal**: Players can build almost any concept, BUT signature abilities are class-locked to preserve identity

**Solution**: 
- **Universal Advantages**: Anyone can buy (Enhanced STR, Flight, etc.)
- **Class-Locked Abilities**: Signature powers only available to specific classes
- **Multiclassing**: Want another class's power? Multiclass into it!

---

## CLASS-LOCKED ABILITIES SYSTEM

### How It Works

**Two Types of Advantages**:

1. **UNIVERSAL ADVANTAGES** (Anyone can buy with CP)
   - Enhanced Ability Scores
   - Damage Resistance
   - Basic Flight
   - Enhanced Move (generic speed boost)
   - Innate Attack (generic energy/elemental damage)
   - Combat Reflexes
   - Danger Sense
   - Etc.

2. **CLASS-LOCKED ABILITIES** (Must have levels in that class)
   - These are thematic powers that define the class fantasy
   - Can ONLY be purchased if you have at least 1 level in the class
   - Represent training, innate biology, or unique methodology

## EXAMPLE MULTICLASS BUILDS

- Can buy Symbol of Hope (requires 11 Paragon, has 10) - NO
- Can cast Level 5 spells (requires 9 Mystic, has 5) - NO

**Why It Works**: Balanced magic knight, but doesn't reach highest powers of either class

---

### BUILD 2: "The Super-Soldier"
**Martial Artist 8 / Paragon 7 (Level 15)**

- Master combatant with weapons (Weapon Master subclass)
- Inspiring leader (Second Wind, Inspiring Presence, Champion)

---

### BUILD 3: "The Elemental Speedster"

---

## SUMMARY: BUILD ANYTHING (WITH BOUNDARIES)

**Freedom**:
- ✅ Multiclass any combination
- ✅ Buy most advantages/powers with CP
- ✅ Create unique concepts

**Boundaries**:
- ⚠️ Signature abilities locked to classes (Infinite Mass Punch, Mind Control, etc.)
- ⚠️ Must invest levels to unlock class-locked powers
- ⚠️ Can't have everything (multiclass = trade-offs)

**Result**:
- Punisher can't do Infinite Mass Punch (needs 5 Speedster levels)
- Flash can't do Mind Control (needs 9 Mentalist levels)
- BUT Martial Artist/Speedster multiclass CAN do Infinite Mass Punch (if they invest 5 Speedster levels)
- System encourages meaningful multiclassing for unique combos
