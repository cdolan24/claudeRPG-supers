**Hero Name**: VOLTAGE

**Hero Concept**: Voltage is a genius engineer who can manipulate electricity and built a high-tech battlesuit.

**Points**: 250 (Superheroic Power Level)  
**Archetype**: Gadgeteer  
**Origin**: Experiment (electrocuted in lab accident, gained powers)  
**Level**: 3

### ABILITY SCORES
**Strength**: 10 (+0)  
**Dexterity**: 16 (+3)  
**Constitution**: 14 (+2)  
**Intelligence**: 18 (+4)  
**Wisdom**: 12 (+1)  
**Charisma**: 13 (+1)

### COMBAT STATS
**Hit Points**: 26 (8 + 2 CON, then 5+2, 5+2)  
**Hit Dice**: 3d8  
**Fatigue Points**: 15 (10 + 2 CON + 3 levels)

**Basic Move**: 45 ft (30 + 15 from DEX)  
**Initiative**: +3 (DEX modifier)

### DEFENSE
**Innate Armor Class**: 15 (10 + 3 DEX + 2 DR bonus)

- **Dodge**: +2 to AC vs one attack
- **Parry**: +2 to AC vs one melee attack

### OFFENSE
**Basic Strike**: +3 (STR 10 + DEX 16 = 26 ÷ 4 = 6.5, round down to +6, but not proficient so no Prof bonus... wait, let me recalculate)

Actually, Basic Strike = ((10+16)÷4) = 6.5 = +6, then if proficient in unarmed add +2 Prof = +8 total. Marcus is not trained in unarmed, so his Basic Strike is just +6.

**Mental Kick**: +2 ((INT 18 + WIS 12 = 30) ÷ 6 = 5, not proficient so +5 only)

**Weapons**:
- **Electric Blast** (Innate Attack): +7 to hit (DEX +3, Prof +2, Specialized Skill +2), 3d6 lightning damage, Range 60 ft

Marcus was a brilliant but reckless engineer at NeoTech Industries. During an experiment with high-voltage energy cells, an explosion electrocuted him.

He built a battlesuit to channel his powers and now fights crime as Voltage, balancing his civilian job with his heroic identity.
