# SUPERHERO RPG v2.5 PATCH NOTES
## Equipment, Healing Advantages, Class Flexibility, & Encounter Design

---

## CORE PHILOSOPHY CLARIFICATION: CLASSES ARE GUIDELINES, NOT PRISONS

### What Classes Actually Do

**CLASSES PROVIDE**:
1. **Baseline Features**: Free abilities at each level (Second Wind, Extra Attack, etc.)
2. **Suggested Build Path**: Advantages that synergize well with class features
3. **CP Efficiency Bonuses**: Class features cost 0 CP (you get them for leveling)
4. **Thematic Framework**: Paragon suggests "heroic leader," but you build YOUR version

**CLASSES DO NOT**:
- ❌ Lock you into specific advantages
- ❌ Prevent multiclassing or hybrid builds
- ❌ Require you to take "class-appropriate" advantages
- ❌ Force you into a role

### Example: Three Different Paragons

**PARAGON A: "Captain America"**
- Takes: Enhanced STR, Combat Reflexes, Leadership
- Role: Frontline inspirational leader
- Playstyle: Shield throws, buff allies, tank damage

**PARAGON B: "Sentry"**
- Takes: Flight, Innate Attack (Cosmic Energy), Damage Resistance
- Role: Flying blaster with tank stats
- Playstyle: Aerial bombardment, ignore class's "melee focus"

**PARAGON C: "Luke Cage"**
- Takes: Damage Resistance (Physical), Regeneration, Tough as Nails
- Role: Unkillable brawler who doesn't inspire anyone
- Playstyle: Walk through bullets, punch things, never goes down

**All three are Paragons. All three are COMPLETELY different.**

### Class-Locked Abilities Revised

**OLD UNDERSTANDING**: "Class-locked abilities prevent non-class members from taking them"

**NEW UNDERSTANDING**: "Class-locked abilities are DEEPLY DISCOUNTED for class members, expensive for others"

**REVISED SYSTEM**:

**Class Members**: Pay listed CP cost  
**Non-Class Members**: Pay **2× CP cost** AND meet minimum ability requirements

**Examples**:

**Infinite Mass Punch** [40 CP for Speedsters, 80 CP for non-Speedsters]
- Requires: DEX 18+, Enhanced Move 3+
- Speedsters: 40 CP (class synergy discount)
- Anyone else: 80 CP (expensive but possible!)
- **Why**: Martial Artist with high DEX and speed can learn it, just costs more

**Mind Control** [60 CP for Mentalists, 120 CP for non-Mentalists]
- Requires: WIS 18+ or CHA 18+
- Mentalists: 60 CP (class training discount)
- Anyone else: 120 CP (learning psionics from scratch)
- **Why**: Mystic with high WIS could learn mind control, just expensive

**Rampage** [40 CP for Juggernauts, 80 CP for non-Juggernauts]
- Requires: STR 16+, CON 16+
- Juggernauts: 40 CP (natural rage)
- Anyone else: 80 CP (learning to go berserk)
- **Why**: Paragon with high STR/CON could learn rage, just costs more

**Result**: Classes are EFFICIENT paths, not exclusive clubs. You can build anything, but class synergies save CP.

### EQUIPMENT NOTES

**Buying with CP vs Currency**:
- **CP Purchase**: Equipment is permanent (Signature Gear), comes back if lost/destroyed
- **Currency Purchase**: Equipment is mundane, lost if destroyed, requires wealth/money

**Using in Combat**:
- **Action to Use**: Most healing items require action (trade-off vs attacking)
- **Bonus Action Items**: Stimpack is bonus action but has side effects
- **Reactions**: No healing items use reactions (would be too strong)

**Stacking Rules**:
- **Cannot use 2 potions in same turn** (double-dipping prevention)
- **CAN use potion + class healing** in same turn (e.g., potion + Second Wind)
- **Regeneration effects don't stack** (only highest applies)

## ENCOUNTER DESIGN GUIDELINES

### CORE PRINCIPLES

**Goal**: Create balanced encounters that:
- Last 4-6 rounds
- Use 30-50% of party resources (HP, FP, abilities)
- Feel challenging without TPK
- Reward tactical decisions

---

### STEP 1: DETERMINE PARTY POWER LEVEL

**Calculate Party Stats**:

1. **Average Party Level** (APL): Add all levels, divide by party size
   - Example: Level 5, 7, 6 party = (5+7+6) ÷ 3 = **APL 6**

2. **Total Party HP**: Add all current HP
   - Example: 70 + 98 + 62 = **230 HP**

3. **Party Damage Per Round** (DPR): Estimate damage output
   - **Tank/Frontline**: 15-25 damage/round
   - **Striker/DPS**: 25-40 damage/round
   - **Support/Caster**: 20-35 damage/round (burst potential higher)
   - Example party: 20 + 35 + 25 = **80 DPR**

4. **Party Roles**: Count tanks, strikers, support
   - Example: 1 tank, 1 striker, 1 support

---

### STEP 2: ENEMY POWER BUDGET

**Threat Level Difficulty**:

| Difficulty | Enemy HP Pool | Enemy DPR | Resources Used |
|------------|---------------|-----------|----------------|
| **Easy** | Party HP × 0.8 | Party HP ÷ 10 | 10-20% |
| **Standard** | Party HP × 1.2 | Party HP ÷ 8 | 30-40% |
| **Hard** | Party HP × 1.5 | Party HP ÷ 6 | 50-70% |
| **Deadly** | Party HP × 2.0 | Party HP ÷ 5 | 80-100% |

**Example: Standard Encounter for APL 7 Party** (230 HP, 80 DPR)
- **Enemy HP Pool**: 230 × 1.2 = **276 HP total**
- **Enemy DPR**: 230 ÷ 8 = **~29 damage per round**

---

### STEP 3: ENEMY COMPOSITION

**Action Economy Matters!**

**RULE**: Enemies should have **1.5-2× as many actions as party**

**For 3-player party**:
- **Minimum**: 5 enemies (4 actions if boss has 2)
- **Optimal**: 6-8 enemies
- **Maximum**: 10 enemies (or combat drags)

**Enemy Types**:

1. **MINIONS** (Low HP, Low Damage)
   - HP: 20-40% of striker HP
   - Damage: 5-10 per attack
   - Purpose: Provide targets, absorb AoE, enable tactical positioning
   - Count: 3-6 minions

2. **ELITES** (Medium HP, Medium Damage)
   - HP: 80-120% of striker HP
   - Damage: 12-18 per attack
   - Purpose: Secondary threats, force target priority
   - Count: 1-2 elites

3. **BOSS** (High HP, High Damage)
   - HP: 120-180% of tank HP
   - Damage: 20-35 per attack (25-35% of tank's HP per round)
   - Purpose: Primary threat, focus fire target
   - Special: 2 attacks OR legendary actions
   - Count: 0-1 boss (not every encounter needs one)

**Budget Formula**:

**Total Enemy HP = Minion HP + Elite HP + Boss HP**

**Example for Standard Encounter** (276 HP budget):
- 4 Minions: 30 HP each = 120 HP
- 1 Elite: 60 HP = 60 HP
- 1 Boss: 96 HP = 96 HP
- **Total: 276 HP** ✓

---

### STEP 4: DAMAGE OUTPUT DISTRIBUTION

**RULE**: Spread damage across enemy types

**Damage Budget** (29 DPR for our example):

**Option A: Boss-Heavy**
- Boss: 16-18 DPR (2 attacks × 8-9 damage)
- Elite: 6-8 DPR (1 attack × 6-8 damage)
- Minions: 5-6 DPR (4 minions × 1-2 damage each)

**Option B: Swarm-Heavy**
- Boss: 12-14 DPR (2 attacks × 6-7 damage)
- Elite: 7-9 DPR (1 attack × 7-9 damage)
- Minions: 8-10 DPR (6 minions × 1-2 damage each)

**Option C: Balanced**
- Boss: 14-16 DPR
- Elites: 8-10 DPR (2 elites × 4-5 damage)
- Minions: 6-8 DPR (4 minions × 1-2 damage)

---

### STEP 5: SPECIAL ABILITIES

**Boss Abilities** (Choose 2-3):

**Offensive**:
- **Multiattack**: 2-3 attacks per action
- **Area Attack**: Recharge 5-6, affects 15-30 ft radius
- **Power Attack**: 1/combat, deal +50% damage on next attack
- **Grab**: Grapple + restrain on hit

**Defensive**:
- **Damage Resistance**: Half damage from physical OR energy
- **Legendary Resistance**: 3/day, auto-succeed on failed save
- **Force Field**: Reaction, +5 AC vs one attack, 3/combat
- **Teleport**: Bonus action, teleport 30 ft, 1/combat

**Utility**:
- **Summon Minions**: Action, summon 2-4 minions, 1/combat
- **Rally**: Bonus action, all allies gain advantage next round, 1/combat
- **Heal**: Bonus action, heal self 20% HP, 1/combat

**Elite Abilities** (Choose 1-2):

- **Pack Tactics**: Advantage when ally is adjacent to target
- **Coordinated Strike**: If 2+ attack same target, gain +2 to hit
- **Defensive Formation**: +2 AC when adjacent to ally
- **Focus Fire**: Bonus action, designate target, all minions attack with advantage

**Minion Abilities** (Choose 0-1):

- **Swarm**: Gain +1 to hit for each ally within 5 ft (max +3)
- **Fragile**: Double damage from AoE attacks
- **Expendable**: When reduced to 0 HP, explode for 1d6 damage in 5 ft radius

---

### STEP 6: ENCOUNTER BALANCE CHECKLIST

Before running encounter, verify:

✅ **HP Budget**: Total enemy HP = Party HP × (0.8 to 2.0)
✅ **DPR Check**: Enemy damage won't one-shot any player (max 35% of HP per round)
✅ **Action Economy**: Enemies have 1.5-2× party actions
✅ **Boss Damage Cap**: Boss deals 25-35% of tank's HP per round (max)
✅ **Minion Count**: 3-6 minions per 3-player party
✅ **Elite Count**: 1-2 elites max
✅ **Boss Count**: 0-1 boss
✅ **Cover/Terrain**: Battlefield has tactical elements (cover, height, hazards)
✅ **Healing Check**: Does party have healing? Adjust difficulty accordingly
✅ **Escape Route**: Can party retreat if losing? (prevents TPK)
