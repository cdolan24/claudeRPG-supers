- **Blitz's Medical Nanites** provided mid-combat recovery
- **Healing Potions** available as backup (Oracle used one)
- **Fast Healing advantage** added +2-4 HP per heal (noticeable but not broken)

### ✅ **RESISTANCE SYSTEM**: CLEAN
- **Guardian's Physical Resistance** worked (didn't apply to force/energy)
- **Shockwave's Energy Resistance** reduced Fireball damage (23 → 11)
- No complicated math, just "half damage"
- Clear when it applies, when it doesn't

### ✅ **EQUIPMENT MATTERED**
- **Power Armor** gave Guardian AC 20 (survived longer)
- **Medical Nanite Injector** was clutch healing (3d8+3)
- **Healing Potions** as backup insurance
- **Reinforced Suit** on Blitz provided AC 18 (dodged several hits)

### ✅ **ACTIVE DEFENSE**: NOT USED
- Party never felt desperate enough to use reactions for +8 AC
- Available as "oh shit" button if needed
- System working as designed (emergency defense)

### ✅ **CLASS FLEXIBILITY**: DEMONSTRATED
- **Guardian** didn't use Paragon starting package (custom power armor build)
- **Blitz** bought Vibration Healing (speedster with healing support!)
- **Oracle** focused on buffs/healing (Haste, Cure Wounds) not just damage
- All three felt distinct despite class suggestions

### ✅ **TACTICAL DECISIONS**: MATTERED
- **Haste on Guardian** provided 3 attacks + AC boost (turned tide)
- **Protective Stance** made Drone miss Oracle (saved concentration)
- **Focus fire mercenaries** eliminated action economy advantage
- **Healing timing** kept Guardian alive

### ✅ **LEGENDARY ACTIONS**: BALANCED
- Shockwave got 3 extra actions per round
- Didn't dominate combat
- Made boss feel threatening without overwhelming

---

## WHAT WORKED PERFECTLY

1. ✅ **HP Formula (CON × 2)**: Party had staying power without being unkillable
2. ✅ **No DR System**: Resistance was simple, clear, no threshold problems
3. ✅ **Reduced Enemy Damage**: Shockwave 26 DPR felt dangerous but fair
4. ✅ **Healing Availability**: Multiple sources (class features, advantages, items) provided sustain
5. ✅ **Equipment System**: Power armor, nanites, potions all felt valuable
6. ✅ **Action Economy**: 5 enemies vs 3 party felt right (was 9 enemies in v2.4, too many)
7. ✅ **Combat Pacing**: Clear phases (clear minions → focus boss → victory)
8. ✅ **Resource Management**: Party used ~40% resources, can continue adventuring
9. ✅ **Heroic Recovery**: Not used this fight, but available as safety net
10. ✅ **Class Flexibility**: Non-standard builds (healing speedster!) worked great

---

## WHAT COULD BE IMPROVED

⚠️ **Minor Issues** (not critical):

1. **Shockwave's Legendary Actions**: Only used ~6 of possible 15 (3 per round × 5 rounds). Could be more aggressive.

2. **Active Defense Never Used**: Party never desperate enough. This is fine (it's emergency button), but could come up in deadlier fights.

3. **Blitz's Kinetic Absorption**: Never triggered (no enemies missed in melee). Subclass feature felt wasted this fight.

4. **Drone Fled**: Felt anticlimactic. Could have fought to the death for better XP/loot. But realistic for AI self-preservation.

5. **Guardian's Intervene**: Never used (3/long rest). No ally was targeted with lethal blow. Again, emergency button.

**None of these break the system.** They're features that didn't come up this specific fight but would in others.

## COMPARISON TO v2.4 TEST (SAME PARTY, SAME ENCOUNTER)

| Metric | v2.4 Result | v2.5 Result | Change |
|--------|-------------|-------------|--------|
| **Combat Length** | 7 rounds (too long) | 5 rounds | ✅ -2 rounds |
| **Party Final HP** | 4/230 (2%, near TPK!) | 137/273 (50%) | ✅ +48% |
| **Guardian HP** | 4/98 (4%) | 48/112 (43%) | ✅ +39% |
| **Blitz HP** | 0/70 (DOWN) | 57/84 (68%) | ✅ +68% |
| **Oracle HP** | 0/62 (DOWN) | 32/77 (42%) | ✅ +42% |
| **Boss Damage/Round** | 32 avg (49% tank HP) | 26 avg (23% tank HP) | ✅ -26% |
| **Minion Count** | 6 mercs | 3 mercs | ✅ -50% |
| **Elite Count** | 2 drones | 1 drone | ✅ -50% |
| **Healing Used** | Minimal (no items) | Significant (multiple sources) | ✅ Sustain |
| **TPK Risk** | VERY HIGH | Low | ✅ Balanced |
| **Fun Factor** | Desperate/stressful | Challenging/exciting | ✅ Better |

**Conclusion**: v2.5 fixes made MASSIVE difference. Same party, same encounter (adjusted), went from near-TPK to comfortable victory.

## SYSTEM VALIDATION

**Equipment System**:
- ✅ Power Armor (AC +9) expensive but powerful

- ✅ Starting equipment tables helpful but optional
- ✅ CP vs currency distinction clear

**Class Flexibility**:

- ✅ "Build anything" philosophy validated

**Encounter Design**:
- ✅ 3 minions, 1 elite, 1 boss = good action economy
- ✅ Boss 26 DPR (23% tank HP/round) = threatening but fair
