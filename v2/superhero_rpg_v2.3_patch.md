# SUPERHERO RPG v2.3 PATCH NOTES
## Class Consolidation & Power Scaling Fixes

## CRITICAL CHANGES

### 1. CLASS CONSOLIDATION: THE BIG THREE OVERLAP

**PROBLEM IDENTIFIED**: Paragon, Brick, and Powerhouse all fill "strong guy" niche with overlap:

| Class | Primary | HP | Main Mechanic | Role |
|-------|---------|-----|---------------|------|
| **Paragon** | STR/CON/CHA | d12 | Inspiring Presence, Flight | Flying tank/leader |
| **Brick** | STR/CON | d12 | Rage, Relentless | Ground tank/soak |
| **Powerhouse** | STR/CON | d12 | Momentum, Throw | Damage/control |

**Issue**: All three are STR/CON, d12 HD, frontline fighters. Too much overlap.

---

## POWER SCALING FIXES

### PROBLEM: Low CP Cost for High Power

**Examples of Broken Combinations**:
- Street-level hero (100 CP) taking Infinite Mass Punch [20 CP] + Enhanced Move 3 [60 CP] = 80 CP = Superman punch at street level
- Level 1 Speedster with starting package (60 CP) + one optional trait (20 CP) = Reality-warping power

**Core Issue**: Optional Traits allow purchase of cosmic-level abilities at low levels

---

### SOLUTION: POWER TIER SYSTEM

#### **TIER 1: STREET LEVEL** (Levels 1-4)

### REVISED OPTIONAL TRAIT COSTS WITH TIER REQUIREMENTS

**SPEEDSTER OPTIONAL TRAITS (REVISED)**:

**Tier 1 Traits** (Levels 1-4):
- Wall Running [10 CP]: Run on walls
- Water Walking [10 CP]: Run on water
- Accelerated Thinking [10 CP]: +3 INT checks when time-sensitive
- Speedster's Luck [15 CP]: Reroll failed save 1/short rest

- Sonic Boom [15 CP]: 60+ ft movement, enemies in path take 2d6 thunder
- Speed Clone [25 CP]: Create 2 afterimages, last 1 minute
- **Infinite Mass Punch [40 CP]**: ← **COST INCREASED FROM 20 CP**
  - **Requires Level 5+**
  - 1/long rest, charge 100 ft straight line, single melee attack
  - Deal 6d6 + STR damage (not 6d6 + all modifiers)
  - Target pushed 20 ft, knocked prone

### CHARACTER POINT SCALING BY LEVEL

**Revised Starting CP by Power Level**:

| Level | Street | Superheroic | Cosmic | Omega |
|-------|--------|-------------|--------|-------|
| 1 | 100 | 200 | 400 | 600 |
| 5 | 150 | 300 | 500 | 800 |
| 10 | 200 | 400 | 600 | 1000 |
| 15 | 250 | 500 | 750 | 1500 |
| 20 | 300 | 600 | 1000 | 2000 |

**CP per Level**: Gain 10 CP per level (same as before)

**Why This Works**:
- Level 1 street hero (100 CP) cannot afford Infinite Mass Punch (40 CP) + Enhanced Move 3 (60 CP) + starting package = 150 CP total (over budget)
- Level 5 street hero (150 CP) STILL can't afford it (needs to be Superheroic tier)
- Level 5 superheroic hero (300 CP) CAN afford it, but now it's balanced against enemies at that tier
- Punisher-level hero maxes out at 150 CP (Tier 1), cannot take Tier 2+ abilities

---

## FINAL CLASS ROSTER (10 CLASSES) ✅

1. **Paragon** (Champion/Guardian/Icon) - Balanced hero leader
2. **Juggernaut** (Breaker/Grappler/Hurler) - Unstoppable force

10. **Trickster** (Illusionist/Teleporter/Shapeshifter) - Skill monkey

**Total**: 10 classes × 3 subclasses = **30 unique archetypes**

**Powerhouse**: DELETED (redundant with Paragon + Juggernaut)

---

## SUMMARY OF v2.3 CHANGES

✅ **Paragon, Brick, Powerhouse** consolidated into **Paragon + Juggernaut** (2 distinct classes)
✅ **Mimic replaced with Trickster** (cleaner mechanics)
✅ **Technopath becomes Machinist subclass** (Gadgeteer subclass 3)
✅ **Power Tier System added** (Level requirements for abilities)
✅ **Infinite Mass Punch** cost increased to 40 CP, requires Level 5+
✅ **Optional Traits** now have tier requirements
✅ **CP scaling** adjusted to prevent low-level cosmic power

**POWER SCALING NOW WORKS**:
- Punisher (Level 3, 125 CP) = Tier 1, mundane weapons + skill
- Spider-Man (Level 7, 320 CP) = Tier 2, enhanced abilities + wall-crawl
- Thor (Level 15, 750 CP) = Tier 3, godlike power + lightning
- Phoenix (Level 20, 1500+ CP) = Tier 4, reality warping

**NEXT STEPS**:

2. Decide Powerhouse fate (delete or redefine)
3. Create full Optional Traits lists with tier requirements
