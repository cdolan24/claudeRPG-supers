**Example**: A Paragon who takes Gadgeteer advantages becomes Iron Patriot. A Mystic with Speedster advantages becomes a Time Mage. The possibilities are endless!

## Building Your Hero

### Step-by-Step Example: "Shadowstrike"

**Concept**: Ninja vigilante with shadow powers  
**Power Level**: Superheroic (250 pts)  
**Primary Class**: Martial Artist  
**Secondary Theme**: Mystic

#### 1. Starting Package (Martial Artist)
- Combat Reflexes [15 pts]
- Weapon Master (All) [30 pts] *(reduced from 45 for package)*
- Enhanced Dodge +1 [15 pts]
- Code of Honor (Warrior's) [-15 pts]
- Overconfidence [-5 pts]
**Net**: 40 pts

#### 2. Attributes (60 pts)
- ST 12 [20 pts] → Base 10 +2
- DX 15 [100 pts] → Base 10 +5, but...
- IQ 12 [40 pts] → Base 10 +2

**Subtotal**: 190 pts, but adjusted to fit budget

#### 3. Additional Advantages (120 pts)
*From Martial Artist pool:*
- Striking ST +3 [15 pts]
- Perfect Balance [15 pts]
- Danger Sense [15 pts]
- Catfall [10 pts]

*From Universal Library (Shadow theme):*
- Invisibility (Switchable, Only in Shadows -20%) [32 pts]
- Clinging [20 pts]
- Silence 3 [15 pts]
- Night Vision 5 [5 pts]
- Acute Hearing 2 [4 pts]

#### 4. Additional Disadvantages (-40 pts = +40 pts)

- Stealth (DX+3) [8 pts]

- Climbing (DX) [2 pts]
- Shadowing (IQ+1) [4 pts]

**Total**: Approximately 250 pts

#### Final Stats

- **HP**: 13 (HT 13)
- **FP**: 13
- **Basic Speed**: 7 (DX 15 + HT 13 ÷ 4)
- **Move**: 7
- **Dodge**: 11 (7 + 3 from Enhanced Dodge + 1 from Combat Reflexes)
- **Parry**: 14 (Karate skill 18 ÷ 2, rounded up)
- **AC**: 14 (10 + 4 from high Dodge-7 = 10 + 4)

---

## Combat & Leveling

### Combat Summary
- **Initiative**: Roll d20 + Basic Speed modifier
- **Attack Roll**: d20 + Proficiency Bonus + relevant skill modifier (or DX for weapons)
- **Damage**: Use GURPS weapon damage (e.g., swing, thrust) + modifiers
- **Defense**: Use Dodge, Parry, or Block (GURPS values + Proficiency Bonus)
- **Armor Class**: 10 + (Dodge - 7) + (DR ÷ 5)

### Leveling Up
Earn XP as per D&D 5e chart. When you level:

1. **Hit Points**: Roll class HD + HT modifier (or take average)
2. **Character Points**: Gain 10 pts per level to spend
3. **Proficiency Bonus**: Increases at 5th, 9th, 13th, 17th (+1 each time)
4. **Class Features**: Unlock at designated levels
5. **Skills**: Spend character points to improve

### Multiclassing
You may spend character points on advantages from other classes' recommendations. Advantages outside your main class cost +5 character points each (less natural affinity).

To formally **multiclass** (gain another class's features):
- Must meet multiclass prerequisites (13 in relevant ability)
- Gain other class's features at level 1 when you take your first level in it
- HD becomes mixed (e.g., d10 for 3 Martial Artist levels, d8 for 2 Gadgeteer levels)

---

## Design Philosophy

### Why This System Works

1. **Guided Freedom**: Classes provide structure for new players, but the Universal Library ensures no two Paragons are alike.

2. **Scalable Complexity**: Begin with class packages, then gradually add unique advantages as you master the system.

3. **Heroic Fantasy**: GURPS point-buy naturally models everything from street vigilantes to cosmic gods.

4. **Familiar Progression**: D&D leveling gives satisfying milestones while GURPS provides mechanical depth.

5. **Genre Flexibility**: Works for Marvel/DC cosmic heroes, street-level vigilantes, anime-style fighters, or mystical avatars.

### GM Guidelines

#### Approving Custom Builds
- Review total character points, not individual choices
- Ensure advantages fit campaign power level
- Encourage creative combinations (Speedster + Mystic = Time Mage!)
- Watch for min-maxing, but allow optimization

#### Balancing Encounters
- Use total party points to gauge difficulty
- Street Level (100-150 pts): Face threats worth 50-100 pts
- Superheroic (200-300 pts): Face threats worth 150-300 pts  
- Cosmic (400-500 pts): Face threats worth 300-500+ pts

#### Growth & Evolution
- Let characters shift focus over time (spend points in new class pools)
- Reward creative power usage
- Allow disadvantage "buy-offs" with earned character points when narratively appropriate
