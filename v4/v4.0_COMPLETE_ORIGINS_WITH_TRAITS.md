# REVISED ORIGINS SYSTEM v4.0
## 11 Core Origins with Starting Traits & Equipment

---

## HOW ORIGINS WORK

Your Origin determines:
1. **Starting Wealth** - How much money you begin with
2. **Free Starting Traits** - Advantages/features you automatically receive
3. **Common Traits** - Advantages that fit your origin thematically (not free, but recommended)
4. **Starting Equipment** - Gear beyond what your class provides
5. **Story Hooks** - Background elements for your character
6. **Typical Disadvantages** - Common drawbacks for your origin type

**Important:** Free starting traits do NOT cost CP. Common traits must be purchased normally.

---

## ORIGIN 1: MUTANT
### "Homo Superior - The Natural Evolution"

**Description:** You have an innate ability that naturally manifests in your world. You are a subspecies - a mutated version of your base species. A cat who can fly is a mutated cat. The X-Men are mutated humans. Your powers are genetic, coded into your DNA, and often manifest during puberty or times of extreme stress.

**Starting Wealth:** 1000 credits (normal upbringing before powers manifested)

---

### FREE STARTING TRAITS

**MUTATION (Mandatory):**
Choose ONE free advantage from the following list (does NOT cost CP):
- Enhanced Attribute +2 (any one attribute) [20 CP value]

- Natural Weapon 1d8 [15 CP value]
- Energy Resistance (one type) [10 CP value]
- Enhanced Movement +20 ft [10 CP value]
- Minor Power (GM approved, max 15 CP value)

**This represents your baseline mutation - the foundation upon which your other powers build.**

**MUTANT PHYSIOLOGY:**
You are genetically distinct from baseline humans. This provides:
- Advantage on Medicine checks to diagnose your own conditions (you understand your biology)
- Can be detected by mutant-detection technology
- May trigger anti-mutant prejudice or pro-mutant recognition

## ORIGIN 11: ONE-OF-A-KIND
### "Unique in All Creation"

**Description:** Your abilities are not a natural extension of yourself, nor a product of something within your control. You are somehow a "one-off" in a way that is not already incorporated in this system. One-of-a-Kind individuals are EXTREMELY RARE - this is not just "I have unique powers." This is "I occupy a specific role in the cosmic order that cannot be taken, replicated, or passed on." You might be:

- **Universal Constant:** Living embodiment of Death, Entropy, Balance, etc.
- **Karmic Necessity:** The universe requires your existence for balance
- **Cosmic Anomaly:** You shouldn't exist, but reality bent around you
- **Narrative Singularity:** You're the main character of reality itself (like Deadpool's awareness)
- **Last of Your Kind in Cosmic Sense:** Not just species (that's Alien), but the final instance of something that cannot be recreated

**This origin should be APPROVED BY GM and used sparingly. It's for truly unique concepts that don't fit elsewhere.**

**Starting Wealth:** Varies wildly (0 to infinite, depending on nature)

---

### FREE STARTING TRAITS

**SINGULAR EXISTENCE (Mandatory):**
You are fundamentally unique. Gain ALL:

- **Cannot Be Duplicated:** Cloning, shapeshifting, illusions of you always fail or are obviously fake
- **Cosmic Recognition:** Beings with cosmic awareness know you're "special" but may not understand why
- **Reality Anchor:** You cannot be erased from timeline or reality (paradox, you persist)
- **Unique Presence:** Magic and powers that work on "everyone" may not work on you (GM discretion)

**NATURE OF UNIQUENESS:**
Work with GM to define what makes you One-of-a-Kind. This isn't a mechanical choice but a narrative one.

**Examples of One-of-a-Kind Nature:**

**OPTION A - COSMIC CONSTANT:**
- You ARE Death, Balance, Entropy, Dream, etc.
- **Functionally Immortal:** Cannot die permanently [50 CP value]
- **Cosmic Awareness:** Know when your domain is affected [50 CP value]

**OPTION B - CHOSEN ONE (LITERAL):**
- Prophecy, destiny, or cosmic narrative demands YOU specifically exist
- **Destiny (Mandatory):** Must fulfill specific role [-40 CP]
- **Plot Armor:** Advantage on death saves and vs effects that would remove you from story [30 CP value]
- **Cosmic Luck:** Can reroll any d20 once per session [20 CP value]

**OPTION C - SINGULAR SURVIVOR:**
- You're the last of something that can NEVER be recreated (not just species - concept itself)
- **Enhanced Attributes** (varied, you're the peak of what you were) [40 CP value]
- **Knowledge Beyond Your Years** [20 CP value]
- **Loneliness:** Social penalty but also immune to certain mental effects [varies]

**OPTION D - REALITY GLITCH:**
- You're an error in reality that became permanent
- **Exist Outside Normal Rules:** Pick one system (magic, physics, narrative) that doesn't fully apply to you [50 CP value]
- **Probability Manipulation (Minor)** [30 CP value]
- **Hunted by Reality Itself:** Universe tries to "fix" you [-30 CP]

**OPTION E - FOURTH WALL AWARENESS:**
- You know you're in a story/game (Deadpool-style)
- **Meta-Knowledge:** Sometimes know things you shouldn't (GM decides when) [40 CP value]
- **Narrative Survival:** If GM forgets you exist, you remind them (literally can't be forgotten)
- **Insanity (Apparent):** Others think you're crazy [-15 CP]

### WHEN TO USE THIS ORIGIN

**USE ONE-OF-A-KIND WHEN:**
- Character concept literally cannot fit other origins
- Being unique is core to character identity (not just flavor)
- GM approves high-concept character
- Campaign has cosmic/metaphysical elements
- Character embodies universal constant or concept

**DO NOT USE ONE-OF-A-KIND FOR:**
- "My powers are unique" (all characters are unique - not enough)
- "I'm the last of my species" (that's Alien origin)
- "I'm really powerful" (that's just high CP character)
- "I want to be special" (be special through roleplay, not origin)
- "I made a deal/experiment/got powers weird" (other origins cover this)

**GM NOTE:** This origin should be rare. Maybe one per campaign, if any. It's for truly exceptional concepts that break the mold. Most characters should NOT be One-of-a-Kind.

---

*End of Origins System v4.0*

---

## USING MULTIPLE ORIGINS (OPTIONAL RULE)

Some characters genuinely have multiple origins. Examples:
- **Scarlet Witch:** Mutant (born with gene) + Magician (learned chaos magic)
- **Cable:** Mutant (telepathy/telekinesis) + Experiment (techno-organic virus) + Time Traveler (from future)
- **Thor:** Alien (Asgardian) + Divine (god of thunder)

**If GM allows multiple origins:**
- Pick one PRIMARY origin (get free traits from this)
- Secondary origins provide story elements but NOT free mechanical benefits
- Can purchase traits appropriate to both origins normally
- Starting wealth = primary origin's wealth

**Example:** Cable (Primary: Time Traveler, Secondary: Mutant, Secondary: Experiment)
- Gets Time Traveler free traits
- Gets Time Traveler starting wealth (200 credits)
- Story includes mutant persecution and experimental infection
- Can buy mutant powers and cybernetics with CP normally

---

## FINAL NOTES

**Your Origin is your starting point, not your limitation.**

A Mutant can learn magic (multiclass into Mystic).
An Experiment subject can make a divine pact.
A Magician can get cybernetic enhancements.

Your Origin explains WHERE YOU CAME FROM.
Your Class explains WHAT YOU DO.
Your Advantages explain WHAT YOU CAN DO.

Together, they create your unique superhero.

**Choose the origin that best fits your CHARACTER'S STORY, not just their powers.**
