- Paragon/Conduit = Superman with energy blasts
- Speedster/Trickster = Ultimate mobility trickster
- Juggernaut/Metamorph = The Thing (stuck in transformed state)
- Mentalist/Mystic = Psychic mage

---

### Multiclassing Prerequisites

| Class | Minimum Required |
|-------|------------------|
| Paragon | STR 13, CHA 13 |
| Juggernaut | STR 15, CON 13 |
| Gadgeteer | INT 13, DEX 13 |
| Mystic | INT 13 or WIS 13 |
| Martial Artist | DEX 13 or STR 13 |

### How Multiclassing Works

**When you gain a level:**
1. Choose which class to advance (original or new class)
2. Roll that class's Hit Die for HP
3. Gain that class's features for the level you reached in it
4. Gain 10 CP to spend anywhere

**Example:** You're a Level 3 Gadgeteer. At Level 4, you decide to multiclass into Mystic.
- You become: **Gadgeteer 3 / Mystic 1** (Total Level 4)
- Roll 1d8 (Mystic HD) + CON for HP
- Gain Mystic's 1st level features
- Gain 10 CP to spend
- Do NOT gain Mystic's starting package (already used Gadgeteer's)

**At Level 5:**
- Choose: Gadgeteer 4 / Mystic 1 OR Gadgeteer 3 / Mystic 2
- Continue pattern

---

### What You Gain from Multiclassing

✅ **You DO gain:**
- Hit Die of new class (roll for HP each level)
- Class features at each level in that class
- Proficiency bonus increases (apply to all classes)
- 10 CP per level (spend anywhere)

❌ **You DON'T gain again:**
- Starting package (only get once, from 1st class)
- Skill proficiencies (keep original class proficiencies only)
- Saving throw proficiencies (keep original class proficiencies only)
- Armor/weapon proficiencies (keep original class proficiencies only)

---

### Important Multiclass Rules

**EXTRA ATTACK DOESN'T STACK**
- If you have Extra Attack from multiple classes, you still only attack twice (not three times)
- Exception: Features that explicitly state they stack

**SPELLCASTING/POWERS**
- If multiclassing two classes that use Focus Points (FP):
  - **Total FP = Highest class's FP + ½ other class's FP (round down)**
  - Example: Mystic 5 (10 FP) / Conduit 3 (6 FP) = 10 + 3 = 13 FP total

**PROFICIENCY BONUS**
- Based on total character level, not individual class levels
- Applies to all abilities from all classes

**ARCHETYPES**
- Choose archetype when you reach 3rd level in each class separately
- Example: Gadgeteer 5 / Mystic 3 has Gadgeteer archetype (chosen at Gadgeteer 3) AND Mystic archetype (chosen at Mystic 3)

## MULTICLASSING FAQ

**Q: Can I multiclass more than twice?**
A: Yes! You can take levels in 3, 4, or even all 10 classes if you meet prerequisites. However, spreading too thin means you miss high-level class features.

**Q: Does my HP go down if I multiclass into lower Hit Die class?**
A: No. You always ADD Hit Dice, never subtract. Gadgeteer 5 (d10) → Mystic 1 (d8) means you roll 5d10 + 1d8 + (6 × CON).

**Q: Can I change my archetype if I multiclass?**
A: No. Once chosen at 3rd level in a class, your archetype is permanent for that class.

**Q: Do I get more CP for multiclassing?**
A: No. You get 10 CP per character level regardless of class. Multiclassing doesn't give bonus CP.

**Q: Should I multiclass?**
A: Only if it fits your character concept! Single-class characters are perfectly viable and get powerful high-level features.

**Q: What's the best multiclass combination?**
A: There is no "best" - it depends on your concept. However, classes that share primary stats work well together:
- STR/CON: Paragon/Juggernaut
- DEX/CON: Speedster/Trickster
- INT/DEX: Gadgeteer/Martial Artist
- INT/WIS/CHA: Mystic/Mentalist
- CON/WIS: Conduit/Metamorph
