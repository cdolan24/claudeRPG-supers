## INTRODUCTION TO GMING SUPERHEROES {#introduction}

### What Makes Superhero RPGs Different?

**POWER SCALE:**
Unlike fantasy RPGs where a 20th level wizard is impressive, superheroes can literally reshape reality. You're not managing a party that fights dragons - you're managing beings who *are* dragons, or can punch planets, or rewrite memories.

**CIVILIAN LIVES:**
Most fantasy heroes are adventurers full-time. Superheroes have secret identities, day jobs, relationships, and responsibilities outside the costume.

**MORAL COMPLEXITY:**
Fantasy: Kill the evil lich, save the kingdom.
Superheroes: Should you kill the villain who'll escape to murder again? What about collateral damage? Do ends justify means?

**MODERN SETTING:**
Players know this world. They can google things. They have smartphones. The police exist. The media exists. Actions have consequences.

**PUBLIC SCRUTINY:**
Your players aren't dungeon-crawling in secret. Every action might be recorded, analyzed, criticized. Social media exists. Public opinion matters.

---

### The Golden Rules of GMing Superheroes

**RULE 1: YES, AND...**
Player wants to do something creative with their powers? Default to "yes, and here's what happens." Don't shut down creativity.

**Bad:** "Your ice powers can't make a slide."
**Good:** "You make an ice slide. It's slippery and you're moving fast - give me an Acrobatics check to control your speed."

**RULE 2: CONSEQUENCES, NOT RESTRICTIONS**
Don't tell players they *can't* do things. Let them do it, then show consequences.

**Bad:** "You can't just kill the villain."
**Good:** "You kill him. His head explodes. The crowd of civilians watches in horror. Children scream. Cameras are rolling. What do you do?"

**RULE 3: SPOTLIGHT SHARING**
Every player should get moments to shine. If the Speedster solved the last problem, give the Mentalist the next one.

**RULE 4: SCALE UP, DON'T SCALE DOWN**
Don't nerf powerful characters. Instead, create challenges that require their full power.

**Bad:** "Your super strength doesn't work on this door because... magic."
**Good:** "You rip the door off. Inside, the villain is holding a dead man's switch connected to explosives throughout the building. Now your super strength doesn't matter - you need a plan."

**RULE 5: THE WORLD REACTS**
Everything players do has consequences. Save the city? They're heroes. Destroy three blocks? Questions arise. Kill someone? The world responds.

### Your Role as GM

You are:
- **The World:** You embody everyone except the PCs
- **The Challenge:** You create obstacles worth overcoming
- **The Referee:** You adjudicate rules fairly
- **The Narrator:** You describe the world vividly
- **The Fan:** You want to see the players succeed (interestingly)

You are NOT:
- **The Enemy:** You're not trying to kill the players
- **The Protagonist:** This is their story, not yours
- **The Dictator:** Players have agency
- **The Author:** You can't force a specific story outcome

---

---

## CAMPAIGN CREATION {#campaign-creation}

### Step 1: Choose Your Setting

**OPTION A: ORIGINAL UNIVERSE**
Create your own superhero world from scratch.

**Advantages:**
- Complete creative freedom
- No canon to worry about
- World reacts to player actions
- Players can be the first heroes

**Disadvantages:**
- More prep work
- Players have no reference points
- Must establish all lore yourself

**Best For:** Creative GMs, players who want blank slate

---

**OPTION B: ESTABLISHED UNIVERSE (Marvel, DC, etc.)**
Set campaign in existing fictional universe.

**Advantages:**
- Players know the world
- Rich lore to draw from
- Existing villains and heroes to use
- Less worldbuilding needed

**Disadvantages:**
- Canon constraints
- Players may have expectations
- Hard to let players affect big events
- Comparison to canon characters

**Best For:** Fans of specific universes, less prep time

---

**OPTION C: ALTERNATE HISTORY**
Real world + superhumans recently emerged.

**Advantages:**
- Familiar baseline (our world)
- Explore "what if superhumans existed"
- Political/social commentary potential
- No canon to memorize

**Disadvantages:**
- Must decide how world changed
- Requires thought about implications
- Can get too real/political

**Best For:** Groups interested in realism, social themes

---

**OPTION D: HYBRID**
Take elements from multiple universes or mix real + fictional.

**Advantages:**
- Use best parts of everything
- "It's like Marvel but..."
- Flexibility

**Disadvantages:**
- Can feel inconsistent
- Players may be confused about what exists

**Best For:** Experienced GMs, specific vision

---

### Step 2: Establish Power Context

**HOW COMMON ARE SUPERHUMANS?**

**RARE (Less than 1 in 100,000):**
- Each superhuman is noteworthy
- Public knows most powered individuals by name
- Government tracks all metahumans
- Every appearance makes news
- Example: Early Marvel Universe, Invincible

**UNCOMMON (1 in 10,000):**
- Powered individuals exist but are notable
- Major cities have local heroes/villains
- Some government oversight
- Media covers major incidents
- Example: DC Universe, X-Men (pre-Krakoa)

**COMMON (1 in 1,000):**
- Powers are recognized minority
- Every city has dozens of powered individuals
- Regulation and laws exist
- Some infrastructure adapted for powers
- Example: My Hero Academia, X-Men (Krakoa era)

**VERY COMMON (1 in 100+):**
- Powers are normal part of society
- Infrastructure built around powered individuals
- Specialized schools, jobs, laws
- Almost everyone knows someone with powers
- Example: The Boys, Gen V

**This affects:**
- How world reacts to players
- What infrastructure exists
- What laws apply
- Story possibilities

---

### Step 3: Define Your Scale

**Where does your campaign operate?**

**NEIGHBORHOOD SCALE (Level 1-5):**
- Protect specific area
- Street crime, gangs, local corruption
- Civilian identity important
- Personal stakes
- Examples: Daredevil's Hell's Kitchen, Spider-Man's Queens

**CITY SCALE (Level 6-10):**
- Protect entire city
- Organized crime, supervillains, disasters
- Becoming known to public
- City-wide threats
- Examples: Batman's Gotham, Superman's Metropolis

**NATIONAL SCALE (Level 11-15):**
- Protect country or region
- Terrorist threats, government conspiracies
- Famous, possibly on team
- Cross-country threats
- Examples: Avengers, Justice League (early missions)

**GLOBAL SCALE (Level 16-18):**
- Protect Earth
- Alien invasions, doomsday weapons
- World-famous, government connections
- Planetary threats
- Examples: Justice League, Fantastic Four

**COSMIC SCALE (Level 19-20):**
- Protect universe(s)
- Cosmic entities, reality threats
- Beyond human concerns
- Universal/multiversal threats
- Examples: Silver Surfer, Green Lantern Corps

**Your campaign can escalate through these scales over time.**

---

### Step 4: Create Your City (If City-Scale Campaign)

**POPULATION:**
- Small city: 100,000-500,000
- Medium city: 500,000-2,000,000
- Large city: 2,000,000-5,000,000
- Metropolis: 5,000,000+

**GEOGRAPHY:**
Define 5-10 key districts:
- **Downtown:** Business center, skyscrapers, wealth
- **Industrial:** Warehouses, factories, docks
- **Residential:** Where people live, neighborhoods
- **Waterfront:** Docks, beaches, maritime
- **Slums:** Poverty, crime, desperation
- **Suburbs:** Families, relative safety
- **University:** Students, research, technology
- **Historic:** Old town, landmarks, tourism

**Each district should have:**
- Distinctive feature
- Dominant demographic
- Crime level
- Key NPCs
- Story potential

**Example: New Beacon City**
- **Population:** 3.2 million
- **Notable For:** Tech industry boom, immigrant diversity
- **Crime Level:** High (organized crime + supervillains)
- **Powered Individuals:** ~3,200 (1 in 1,000)
- **Key Districts:** 
  - Silicon Heights (tech companies)
  - Old Harbor (docks, corruption)
  - University District (students, labs)
  - The Spire (skyscraper forest)
  - Sanctuary (immigrant neighborhood)

---

### Step 5: Establish Opposition

**WHO ARE THE THREATS?**

Every campaign needs 3-5 types of opposition:

**STREET CRIME:**
- Muggers, gangs, drug dealers
- Low-level, always present
- Easy to beat but constant
- Shows heroes are needed

**ORGANIZED CRIME:**
- Crime families, syndicates
- Recurring villains, lieutenants
- Political/police corruption
- Harder to solve permanently

**SUPERVILLAINS:**
- Powered antagonists
- Personal nemeses
- Gimmicks and themes
- Dramatic confrontations

**CORPORATE MALFEASANCE:**
- Legal but immoral companies
- Can't just punch them
- Requires investigation, exposure
- Complex moral situations

**GOVERNMENT CORRUPTION:**
- Dirty cops, corrupt politicians
- Abuse of power
- Can't always fight openly
- Political consequences

**NATURAL DISASTERS:**
- Earthquakes, fires, floods
- No villain to fight
- Pure heroism, rescue missions
- Shows powers used for good

**ALIEN/MYSTICAL THREATS:**
- Non-human antagonists
- Different motivations
- Exotic challenges
- Raises stakes

**Pick 3-5 that fit your tone and prepare examples of each.**

---

### Step 6: Create Your First Arc

**ARC STRUCTURE (6-10 sessions):**

**Sessions 1-2: INTRODUCTION**
- Meet the team
- Establish status quo
- Small victories
- Introduce major players

**Sessions 3-5: RISING ACTION**
- Escalating challenges
- Personal stakes raised
- Connections revealed
- Villain's plan unfolds

**Sessions 6-8: COMPLICATIONS**
- Setbacks and failures
- Moral dilemmas
- Relationships tested
- Secrets revealed

**Sessions 9-10: CLIMAX & RESOLUTION**
- Final confrontation
- Character choices matter
- Resolve arc threads
- Set up next arc

**FIRST ARC SHOULD:**
- Introduce world and tone
- Let each player shine
- Establish threats and allies
- End with sense of accomplishment
- Hook into next arc

---

### Step 7: Prep NPCs

**You need three types:**

**SUPPORTING CAST (8-12 characters):**
- People players interact with regularly
- Civilian identities (coworkers, family, friends)
- Hero identities (contacts, allies, authorities)
- Each has: Name, occupation, personality trait, secret

**VILLAINS (3-5 for first arc):**
- One main villain
- 2-3 lieutenants/henchmen
- 1-2 wildcards (may help or hinder)
- Full builds for major fights

**BACKGROUND NPCs:**
- Generic civilians, cops, criminals
- Use stock stat blocks
- Name them when they become important

---

## ENCOUNTER DESIGN & BALANCING {#encounter-design}

### The Challenge of Superhero Balance

**Traditional RPG:** "Four 5th level characters fight two CR 5 monsters."
**Superhero RPG:** "The flying brick, the reality warper, the speedster who can't be hit, and the guy with a bow fight... what?"

**Superhero balance is NOT about equal power levels. It's about equal narrative importance.**

---

### The Power Level Calculation (Revised for Play)

We established this formula in testing:

**PARTY POWER LEVEL (PPL):**
```
PPL = (Total Party HP) + (Total Party DPR × 5) + (Average Party AC × 5 × Number of PCs)
```

**ENEMY POWER LEVEL (EPL):**
```
EPL = (Total Enemy HP) + (Total Enemy DPR × 5) + (Average Enemy AC × 5 × Number of Enemies)
```

**DIFFICULTY RATIO:**
```
Ratio = PPL / EPL
```

**DIFFICULTY SCALE (From Combat Testing):**
| Ratio | Difficulty | Party HP After | Outcome |
|-------|-----------|----------------|----------|
| 1.3-1.5 | Easy | 95%+ | No real danger |
| 1.15-1.25 | Medium | 70-85% | Standard fight |
| 0.9-1.1 | Hard | 40-60% | Serious threat |
| 0.7-0.85 | Deadly | 0-30% | TPK possible |
| <0.7 | TPK | 0% | Run or die |

---

### Quick Encounter Building

**For GMs who don't want to calculate:**

**EASY ENCOUNTER:**
- Enemies have 50% of party's total HP
- Enemies deal 75% of party's total DPR
- Party has +2-3 AC advantage

**MEDIUM ENCOUNTER:**
- Enemies have 70% of party's total HP
- Enemies deal 90% of party's total DPR
- Party has +1-2 AC advantage

**HARD ENCOUNTER:**
- Enemies have 90% of party's total HP
- Enemies deal 110% of party's total DPR
- AC roughly equal

**DEADLY ENCOUNTER:**
- Enemies have 120% of party's total HP
- Enemies deal 130% of party's total DPR
- Enemies have +1-2 AC advantage

---

### Example Encounter Building

**Party of 4 (Level 10):**
- **Sentinel** (Paragon 10): HP 90, AC 18, DPR 22
- **Shadowstrike** (Trickster 10): HP 70, AC 17, DPR 28
- **Inferno** (Conduit 10): HP 90, AC 15, DPR 30
- **Forge** (Gadgeteer 10): HP 75, AC 16, DPR 24

**Party Totals:**
- Total HP: 325
- Total DPR: 104
- Average AC: 16.5

**PPL = 325 + (104 × 5) + (16.5 × 5 × 4) = 325 + 520 + 330 = 1175**

---

**MEDIUM ENCOUNTER DESIGN:**

Target EPL: 950-1000 (ratio ~1.2)

**Option 1: Single Boss + Minions**
- **Boss:** HP 120, AC 18, DPR 35 (PL: 120 + 175 + 90 = 385)
- **4 Minions:** HP 40 each, AC 15, DPR 12 each (PL: 40 + 60 + 75 = 175 each = 700 total)
- **Total EPL:** 1085 (Ratio: 1.08 = HARD, adjust by removing 1 minion)
- **Adjusted EPL:** 910 (Ratio: 1.29 = MEDIUM)

**Option 2: Elite Squad**
- **3 Elites:** HP 85 each, AC 17, DPR 28 each (PL: 85 + 140 + 85 = 310 each = 930 total)
- **Total EPL:** 930 (Ratio: 1.26 = MEDIUM) ✓

**Option 3: Horde**
- **12 Soldiers:** HP 35 each, AC 15, DPR 10 each (PL: 35 + 50 + 75 = 160 each = 1920 total)
- Wait, that's too much! Use 6 soldiers instead.
- **6 Soldiers:** PL = 960 (Ratio: 1.22 = MEDIUM) ✓

---

### The Action Economy Problem

**Problem:** Four players get four actions per round. One boss gets one action per round. Even if the boss is powerful, players overwhelm through numbers.

**Solutions:**

**SOLUTION 1: LEGENDARY ACTIONS**
Boss gets 2-3 actions per round outside its turn.
- 1 Legendary Action: Make one attack
- 2 Legendary Actions: Move + special ability
- 3 Legendary Actions: Use powerful ability

**Example:**
**TITAN** (Boss villain)
- At end of each PC's turn, Titan gets 1 legendary action
- Can use legendary action to: Attack (1 action), Move (1 action), or Shockwave (2 actions)

**SOLUTION 2: MINIONS**
Boss has 3-6 minions to absorb actions and threaten players.
- Minions are weak but numerous
- Force players to split focus
- Boss + minions = balanced action economy

**SOLUTION 3: LAIR ACTIONS**
Environment acts on initiative count 20.
- Falling debris
- Environmental hazards
- Traps activating
- Gives boss effective extra actions

**SOLUTION 4: PHASES**
Boss changes at 50% HP, gaining new abilities or refreshing resources.
- Prevents alpha strike
- Keeps combat interesting
- Signals progress

**USE 2-3 OF THESE FOR BOSS FIGHTS**

---

### Encounter Types Beyond Combat

**RESCUE MISSIONS:**
- Save civilians from danger
- Time limit (building collapse, drowning, etc.)
- Success = number of people saved
- Not about killing villain

**INVESTIGATION:**
- Find clues before villain acts
- Social encounters, research
- Success = preventing crime
- Not about fighting at all

**CHASE SCENES:**
- Pursuit through city
- Skill challenges + combat
- Success = catching/escaping target
- Environment is main obstacle

**NATURAL DISASTERS:**
- No villain, just crisis
- Rescue, containment, coordination
- Success = lives saved
- Pure heroism

**SOCIAL COMBAT:**
- Convince, negotiate, inspire
- Charisma skills matter
- Success = changing minds
- Violence might be wrong choice

**PUZZLES:**
- Power-based problem solving
- Creative use of abilities
- Success = clever solution
- Intelligence matters

**STEALTH MISSIONS:**
- Infiltration, espionage
- Avoiding detection
- Success = information gained
- Different skills matter

**Mix these types for variety. Not every session should be combat.**

---

### The Five-Room Dungeon (Superhero Version)

Classic RPG structure adapted for superheroes:

**ROOM 1: ENTRANCE/GUARDIAN**
- Hook that draws heroes in
- Initial challenge/clue
- Sets tone and stakes
- Example: Alarm at museum, security guard injured

**ROOM 2: PUZZLE/ROLEPLAY**
- Non-combat challenge
- Use investigation, skills, social
- Gather information
- Example: Witnesses saw different things, piece together what happened

**ROOM 3: RED HERRING/SETBACK**
- False lead or complication
- Something goes wrong
- Raises stakes
- Example: Security footage shows hero committing crime (frame job)

**ROOM 4: CLIMAX/COMBAT**
- Major confrontation
- Villain reveals plan
- All skills might be needed
- Example: Confront villain at their lair

**ROOM 5: RESOLUTION/REWARD**
- Wrap up loose ends
- Save the day
- Set up next adventure
- Example: Clear hero's name, discover bigger conspiracy

**This structure works for 3-4 hour sessions.**

---

### Balancing Powerful Abilities

**PROBLEM:** Player has ability that trivializes challenges.

**WRONG SOLUTION:** "Your telepathy doesn't work because... reasons."

**RIGHT SOLUTIONS:**

**SOLUTION 1: MAKE IT WORK, ADD COMPLICATIONS**
- "Yes, you read his mind. He's planning to blow up City Hall at noon. But his mind is also booby-trapped - you take 3d8 psychic damage and the psychic scream alerts his telepath boss."

**SOLUTION 2: SMART ENEMIES**
- Villain knows heroes' powers
- Has countermeasures prepared
- Forces heroes to adapt
- "The villain is wearing a telepathy blocker. Plan B?"

**SOLUTION 3: ETHICAL COMPLICATIONS**
- Using power causes problems
- "You can mind control the mayor into signing the bill... but is that right?"
- Make players question if they should, not if they can

**SOLUTION 4: SCALE THE CHALLENGE**
- Problem is too big for one power
- "You can fly through the city in 30 seconds. Great. The bombs are in 47 different locations and explode in 2 minutes. What's your plan?"

**SOLUTION 5: FOCUS ELSEWHERE**
- Powerful ability solves THIS problem
- But creates NEW problem
- "You phase through the wall. Inside, the villain has 30 hostages and a dead man's switch. Your phasing doesn't help now."

---

### Example: Handling Specific Problem Powers

**TELEPATHY (Reading minds trivializes social encounters)**

**Don't:** Ban mind reading or make everyone immune

**Do:**
- Important NPCs have mental defenses (but cost them something to maintain)
- Reading minds reveals contradictory information (people lie to themselves)
- Telepathic contact can be two-way (villain reads you back)
- Information isn't always useful ("He's thinking about lunch")
- Legal/ethical issues with mind reading
- Some minds are dangerous to read (alien/cosmic entities)

---

**INTANGIBILITY (Makes character unhittable)**

**Don't:** Say "you can't phase through that"

**Do:**
- Can't interact with world while intangible (can't save falling person)
- Enemy has area effects that don't require touch
- Villain has intangibility too (now you can't hit them either)
- Civilians in danger need solid hero to protect them
- Some materials disrupt intangibility
- Limited duration/uses per day

---

**SUPER SPEED (Takes multiple actions before enemies react)**

**Don't:** Say "you can't do that"

**Do:**
- Environment is dangerous at super speed (innocent bystanders, fragile objects)
- Thinking speed isn't as fast (can move fast but must decide what to do)
- Stamina limits (can be fast but gets exhausted)
- Enemies with super speed too
- Rescue missions where speed helps but doesn't solve everything
- Speed can't solve social/mystery problems

---

**TELEPORTATION (Trivializes infiltration, escape)**

**Don't:** Say "you can't teleport there"

**Do:**
- Must see/know destination (can't teleport into unknown vault)
- Teleportation can be tracked/detected
- Anti-teleportation fields in secure locations
- Can teleport but then what? (Guards are alerted)
- Limited uses per day
- Dangerous to teleport with others

---

**FLIGHT (Bypasses ground obstacles)**

**Don't:** Say "you can't fly here"

**Do:**
- Flying makes you visible/obvious
- Some threats are aerial
- Can't carry everyone
- Weather affects flight
- Some objectives are underground
- Flying doesn't solve most problems (can fly but still must negotiate/investigate/think)

---

### The "Batman Problem"

**PROBLEM:** One character is non-powered in party of powerhouses.

**WRONG APPROACH:** Make them useless or force them to be sidekick.

**RIGHT APPROACH:** Give them spotlight moments where powers don't help.

**Situations Where Batman Outshines Superman:**
- Investigation and detective work
- Social situations requiring subtlety
- Tech/science problems
- Strategic planning
- Stealth missions
- Situations where powers would make things worse
- Moral/ethical dilemmas

**Also:**
- Give non-powered characters more CP (they need it)
- Let them be the team strategist
- Their lack of powers makes them relatable to civilians
- They can go places superhumans can't (public without attention)

**Remember:** Batman is on Justice League for reasons. Make those reasons matter in your game.

---

### Creating Challenges for Overpowered Characters

**THE PROBLEM:** Player can destroy planets. How do you challenge them?

**THE ANSWER:** Don't challenge their power. Challenge their judgment.**

---

### The Seven Types of Superhero Challenges

**1. THE HOSTAGE SITUATION**
- Power doesn't matter if using it kills innocents
- "The building is rigged to explode if you attack"
- Requires: Restraint, planning, precision

**Example:**
Villain has 50 hostages. He has a dead man's switch. If his heart stops, explosives detonate. Player's super strength doesn't help - they need to disarm him carefully or find another solution.

---

**2. THE MORAL DILEMMA**
- Multiple problems, can't solve all
- Must choose who to save
- No right answer

**Example:**
Villain has set up two disasters simultaneously on opposite ends of city. Players must choose which to stop. People will die no matter what. The question isn't "can you win?" but "who do you save?"

---

**3. THE INVESTIGATION**
- Can't punch your way through mystery
- Requires: Intelligence, social skills, research

**Example:**
Someone is killing metahumans but making it look like accidents. Super strength doesn't solve murder mysteries. Must investigate, gather clues, piece together conspiracy.

---

**4. THE POLITICAL SOLUTION**
- Villain hasn't technically done anything illegal
- Or is too publicly visible to attack
- Requires: Social skills, law, strategy

**Example:**
Corporate executive is exploiting metahumans legally. Running sweatshops staffed by desperate powered individuals. Contract says they volunteered. Media loves him. Can't just punch him - need to expose him, sway public opinion, or find legal angle.

---

**5. THE TIME CRUNCH**
- Power doesn't matter if you're too slow
- Multiple objectives, limited time
- Must prioritize

**Example:**
Earthquake has caused 100+ emergencies simultaneously. Fires, collapses, trapped people, broken gas mains. Players have incredible power but can't be everywhere. Must triage, delegate, accept they can't save everyone.

---

**6. THE RECURSIVE PROBLEM**
- Solving it creates new problem
- Using power makes things worse
- Requires: Creativity, restraint

**Example:**
Villain is holding people on bridge. If you attack him, he drops them. If you save falling people, he moves and threatens more. If you destroy bridge to catch everyone at once, debris falls on boats below. Every solution creates new problem. Must think creatively.

---

**7. THE UNKNOWN THREAT**
- Can't fight what you don't understand
- Power doesn't help against mystery
- Requires: Caution, investigation

**Example:**
People are vanishing. No witnesses, no clues, no pattern. Super speed doesn't help when you don't know where to go. Must investigate carefully, gather information, discover what's happening before can solve it.

---

### The Kryptonite Approach (Use Sparingly)

Sometimes you need to directly counter a power. That's okay - **but use it rarely and make it make sense.**

**GOOD USE OF KRYPTONITE:**
- Villain researched heroes specifically
- Countermeasure is logical based on power
- Heroes can overcome with creativity/teamwork
- Used for important fights only

**BAD USE OF KRYPTONITE:**
- Random goons have perfect counter
- Makes no sense how they got it
- Completely negates power
- Used constantly

**Example Good Kryptonite:**
Villain fighting Inferno (fire controller) has been studying him for months. Lair is filled with flame-retardant chemicals, has fire suppression systems, wears heat-resistant suit. Makes Inferno work harder but doesn't make him useless - he adapts.

**Example Bad Kryptonite:**
Random thugs all have anti-teleportation devices because... reasons. Teleporter can't use their main power at all. Feels like GM punishing player.

---

### Managing Flight

**Flight breaks a lot of traditional challenges.** Here's how to handle it:

**DON'T:**
- Constantly create "no fly zones"
- Say "you can't fly here because magic"
- Punish players for using signature ability

**DO:**

**1. MAKE FLIGHT VISIBLE:**
- Guards see flying person approaching
- Snipers target flyers
- Media spots flying heroes
- Can't be stealthy while flying

**2. CREATE AERIAL THREATS:**
- Enemy flyers
- Anti-aircraft weapons
- Flying monsters
- Air-to-air combat

**3. GROUND-BASED OBJECTIVES:**
- Must protect ground-level civilians
- Objective is underground
- Puzzle requires being on ground
- Social situation where flying is inappropriate

**4. USE FLIGHT CREATIVELY:**
- Scout from above (advantage)
- Rescue falling people
- Carry non-flyers
- High ground in combat
- Flight should feel useful, not overpowered

**5. ENVIRONMENTAL HAZARDS:**
- Severe weather grounds flyers
- Strong winds make flight difficult
- Lightning danger at altitude
- Thin air at high altitude

---

### Managing Super Speed

**Super Speed breaks action economy and creates problems.** Handle it carefully.

**THE SPEEDSTER DILEMMA:**
- Logically should get 10+ actions per round
- Would dominate every combat
- Other players feel useless
- But nerfing speed feels wrong

**SOLUTION: SPEED AS UTILITY, NOT DOMINATION**

**IN COMBAT:**
- Speedster gets normal actions
- Speed gives: High initiative, ability to disengage freely, advantage on DEX saves, extra movement
- **Don't:** Give 10 actions per turn
- **Do:** Make speed feel impactful without breaking game

**OUT OF COMBAT:**
- Speed lets them do more in same time
- Can scout entire area quickly
- Can search large space fast
- Can get to emergency before others
- Speed shines in utility, not combat domination

**CHALLENGES FOR SPEEDSTERS:**
- Thinking speed isn't super (must still decide what to do)
- Multiple simultaneous emergencies (can't be everywhere)
- Fragile environment (running too fast breaks things)
- Stamina limits (moving fast is exhausting)
- Precision tasks (moving fast reduces accuracy)

**Example:**
Building is collapsing. Speedster can rescue 5 people per round (using super speed). But there are 30 people and building collapses in 4 rounds. Speed helps but doesn't trivialize - must still make hard choices about who to save first.

---

### Managing Telepathy/Mind Control

**Most broken powers in superhero games.** Handle with care.

**TELEPATHY PROBLEMS:**
- "I read villain's mind to learn plan" (trivializes mystery)
- "I read witness's mind to find truth" (trivializes investigation)
- "I read everyone's mind constantly" (exhausting for GM)

**SOLUTIONS:**

**1. MENTAL DEFENSES:**
- Important NPCs have mental shields
- Costs them concentration to maintain
- Choice: Maintain shields or use powers effectively
- Villains prepared for telepaths

**2. INFORMATION OVERLOAD:**
- Reading mind gives you their thoughts
- People's thoughts are chaotic, contradictory
- Must interpret what you sense
- "He's thinking about his daughter, his hatred for you, what he had for breakfast, and plotting murder simultaneously"

**3. PSYCHIC BACKLASH:**
- Some minds are dangerous
- Reading villain's mind hurts you
- Alien/cosmic minds are incomprehensible
- Insane minds can damage telepath

**4. TWO-WAY CONNECTION:**
- When you read mind, they sense you
- Reveals your presence
- Strong-willed can read you back
- Mental combat

**5. ETHICAL CONCERNS:**
- Using telepathy without consent is violation
- Heroes might refuse to do it
- Legal issues with psychic evidence
- Public doesn't trust telepaths

**6. LIMITED RANGE:**
- Must be relatively close
- Line of sight helps
- Strong emotions easier to read
- Distant/shielded minds harder

**MIND CONTROL:**
- Most controversial power
- Should require sustained concentration
- Target gets saves to resist
- Duration limited
- Ethical nightmare (heroes shouldn't do this?)
- Legal ramifications

---

### Managing Invulnerability/Regeneration

**PROBLEM:** Character takes no/minimal damage, heals instantly.

**SOLUTIONS:**

**1. PROTECT OTHERS:**
- You're invulnerable, civilians aren't
- Must shield others from harm
- Can tank hits but people die if you don't position well

**2. INCAPACITATION:**
- Can't be killed but can be trapped
- Buried under building
- Frozen in ice
- Trapped in force field
- Thrown into space

**3. STAMINA/EXHAUSTION:**
- Regeneration is tiring
- Each use costs something
- Eventually runs out
- Can be worn down

**4. EXOTIC DAMAGE:**
- Normal damage doesn't work
- Psychic attacks bypass invulnerability
- Magic requires different defenses
- Reality warping ignores durability

**5. OBJECTIVES OTHER THAN SURVIVAL:**
- Need to solve puzzle (invulnerability doesn't help)
- Need to convince someone (can't tank your way through social)
- Need to be stealthy (being shot still makes noise)

**6. OVERWHELMING FORCE:**
- Invulnerable to small arms
- Tank rounds still hurt
- Nuclear blast still incapacitates
- Tiers of durability

---

### Managing Reality Warping

**PROBLEM:** "I warp reality to solve problem."

**If you allowed reality warping, you signed up for this.** Don't nerf it - embrace it.

**SOLUTIONS:**

**1. SCALE LIMITS:**
- Can warp small area, not planet
- Can affect physical matter, not abstract concepts
- Power level determines scope

**2. STABILITY COST:**
- Warping reality is unstable
- Might have unexpected side effects
- Universe "corrects" eventually
- Each use risks backfire

**3. KNOWLEDGE LIMITS:**
- Must understand what you're warping
- Can't warp something you don't comprehend
- Alien tech or magic resists (don't understand it)

**4. CONTESTED REALITY:**
- Other reality warpers oppose you
- Universe itself resists major changes
- Roll to see if warp succeeds

**5. ETHICAL WEIGHT:**
- Warping reality affects free will
- Creating matter from nothing violates thermodynamics (somewhere else loses that matter)
- Heavy moral implications

**6. TIER APPROPRIATE:**
- Reality warping should be Tier 4-5 power
- If player has it at low level, major threat has it too

**Honestly:** Reality warping is hard to GM. If player wants it, have session zero discussion about limits.

- Can't make decisions
- No time for roleplay
- Exhausting

**Fix:** Slow down, give breather scenes, let players talk

**GOOD PACE:**
- Mix of action and calm
- Players engaged but not exhausted
- Time for jokes and character moments
- Sense of momentum

---

### Creating Memorable Moments

**RULE OF COOL:**
If it's awesome, allow it (even if technically impossible).

**Player:** "I want to grab the rocket mid-flight, ride it up, then throw it back at the villain's ship."

**Bad Response:** "You can't do that, it doesn't work that way."

**Good Response:** "That's AWESOME. Give me an Athletics check to grab it, then Acrobatics to stay on, then STR check to throw. High DCs but if you pull it off..."

**PRINCIPLES:**
- Reward creative thinking
- Let players be awesome
- Say "yes, and" not "no"
- Make success feel earned
- Failure should be interesting

---

### Failure Forward

**BAD FAILURE:** "You fail to pick the lock. Nothing happens."

**GOOD FAILURE:** "You pick the lock but trigger silent alarm. Guards are coming. What do you do?"

**Failure should:**
- Move story forward
- Create new problems
- Add complications
- Never just stop progress

---

### Cliffhangers

**END SESSIONS ON:**
- "The villain reveals their true plan..."
- "The building explodes with you inside..."
- "Your secret identity is about to be exposed..."
- "An unexpected ally appears..."
- "You discover you've been betrayed..."

**DON'T END ON:**
- Middle of combat (frustrating)
- Waiting for player decision (puts pressure on them)
- Boring moment (no excitement for next time)

---

## HOUSE RULES & MODIFICATIONS {#house-rules}

### Common House Rules

**CRITICAL SUCCESS/FAILURE (d20 rolls):**

**Standard:**

Resting takes longer in realistic campaign.

**Standard:**
- Short rest: 1 hour
- Long rest: 8 hours

**Gritty:**
- Short rest: 8 hours
- Long rest: 1 week

**Effect:** Makes resources more precious, adds tension

**Good for:** Street-level campaigns, grounded stories

**Bad for:** High-power campaigns, new players

---

**COLLATERAL DAMAGE:**

Track property damage and civilian casualties.

**After each big fight:**
- Estimate damage in dollars
- Count civilian casualties/injuries
- Public opinion shifts
- Insurance rates increase
- Government attention

**Effect:** Makes players think before smashing things

**Track with simple scale:**
- Minimal: <$10,000, no injuries
- Moderate: $10,000-$100,000, 1-5 injuries
- Heavy: $100,000-$1,000,000, 5-20 injuries, 0-1 deaths
- Catastrophic: $1,000,000+, 20+ injuries, multiple deaths

**Consequences:**
- Public opinion shifts
- Media coverage
- Legal/insurance issues
- Government oversight

---

**SOCIAL MEDIA:**

Modern superhero setting has social media.

**Each major action:**
- Roll d20 for public reaction
- 1-5: Negative reaction, hashtags criticize you
- 6-15: Mixed reaction, debate
- 16-20: Positive reaction, trending as hero

**Effect:** Adds modern realism, consequences for actions

**Track:** Reputation score (0-100)
- 0-20: Hated, wanted by police
- 21-40: Distrusted, controversial
- 41-60: Mixed, some support
- 61-80: Liked, generally trusted
- 81-100: Loved, idolized

---

**CALLED SHOTS:**

Let players target specific body parts.

**Take -5 to attack roll to:**
- **Head:** +5 damage, target makes CON save or stunned
- **Arm:** Target drops weapon
- **Leg:** Target's speed reduced by 10 ft
- **Weapon:** Disarm (vs Athletics or Acrobatics)
- **Weak Point:** Bypass armor (ignore AC bonus from armor)

**Effect:** More tactical combat, rewards system mastery

---

### Power Level Adjustments

**IF CHARACTERS TOO WEAK:**
- Start with more CP (150 instead of 100)
- Grant bonus CP at milestones
- Give them powerful gear
- Reduce enemy numbers/HP

**IF CHARACTERS TOO STRONG:**
- Scale up enemies
- Add complications (hostages, time limits)
- Environmental hazards
- Introduce countermeasures
- Multiple simultaneous threats

**DON'T:**
- Nerf existing abilities (feels bad)
- Take away powers (unless story-driven)
- Fudge dice regularly (players notice)

---

### Multiclassing Rules Reminder

**From Complete Classes document:**
- Must meet prerequisites (13+ in specific abilities)
- Gain Hit Die, class features, CP
- Don't gain: Proficiencies, starting package (again)
- Extra Attack doesn't stack
- FP combines: Highest + ½ others

**HOUSE RULE OPTION: Free Multiclass**
- No prerequisites
- Let players mix freely
- More character variety
- Risk of weird combinations

---

Can't talk forever.

### Problem: Players Are Murderous Toward Each Other

**SYMPTOMS:**
- PvP conflict
- Stealing from party
- Betrayal
- Tension at table

**SOLUTIONS:**

**1. SESSION ZERO:**
Set expectation: "We're a team."
- No PvP without consent
- Party works together
- Conflict is fine, betrayal isn't

**2. IN-GAME CONSEQUENCES:**
Other heroes respond.
- "If you attack teammate, you're kicked off team"
- "Hero community ostracizes you"
- Make it not worth it

**3. TALK OUTSIDE GAME:**
Real conversation needed.
- Why are they doing this?
- Is there problem at table?
- Can we resolve it?

**4. VILLAIN UNITES THEM:**
Common enemy forces cooperation.
- Too powerful to beat alone
- Must work together
- Remind them they're team

**5. LAST RESORT: REMOVE PLAYER:**
If they won't cooperate and ruins fun.
- Not every player fits every group
- It's okay to ask them to leave
- Protect table's fun

---

### Problem: Rules Arguments

**SYMPTOMS:**
- Constant debates
- Looking up rules mid-game
- Slows play
- Frustration

**SOLUTIONS:**

**1. GM MAKES CALL:**
During session, GM's ruling is final.

- "We'll look it up after session"
- Keep game moving

**2. REVIEW BETWEEN SESSIONS:**
Discuss rules in downtime.
- Look up official ruling
- Agree on interpretation
- Document house rules

**3. RULES LAWYER BECOMES RULES HELPER:**
Assign them to help.
- "You look up rules during play"
- "Help me remember mechanics"
- Turn problem into solution

**4. SIMPLIFY:**
If rule is complicated, simplify it.
- "Too complex, here's simpler version"
- Easier than constant arguments

**5. RULE OF COOL OVERRIDE:**
Cool trumps rules.
- "Technically no, but it's awesome, so yes"
- Prioritize fun

## CONCLUSION

### Final Advice for GMs

**1. PREP LESS, IMPROVISE MORE:**
Don't write novels. Prep situations, not solutions. Players will surprise you - roll with it.

**2. FAIL FORWARD:**
Never let failure stop story. Failure creates complications, not dead ends.

**3. SPOTLIGHT EVERYONE:**
Every player should get hero moments. Rotate focus deliberately.

**4. SAY YES:**
Default to "yes, and" not "no." Reward creativity.

**5. CONSEQUENCES MATTER:**
Actions have results. World reacts to players.

**6. HAVE FUN:**
If you're not enjoying it, something's wrong. Fix it.

**7. COMMUNICATE:**
Talk to players. Check in. Adjust based on feedback.

**8. BE FLEXIBLE:**
Your story is important. Players' fun is more important.

**9. LEARN FROM MISTAKES:**
Every session teaches you something. Improve continuously.

**10. TRUST YOUR PLAYERS:**
They want good story too. Collaborate, don't dictate.

---

### When Things Go Wrong

**SESSION BOMBS:**
It happens. Learn and move on. Next session can fix it.

**PLAYERS HATE NPC:**
Roll with it. Let them defeat/confront NPC.

**COMBAT TOO EASY:**
Add reinforcements mid-fight. Villain had backup plan.

**COMBAT TOO HARD:**
Friendly NPC arrives to help. Villain gets cocky and makes mistake.

**STORY DERAILED:**
Players found better story than yours. Follow their lead.

**RULES CONFUSION:**
Make ruling, move on, research later.

**PLAYER CONFLICT:**
Pause session. Handle out of game. Don't force resolution in-game.

**YOU'RE UNPREPARED:**
Improvise. Use random encounter. Make it about character development.

**YOU'RE BURNT OUT:**
Take break. Let someone else GM one-shot. It's okay to need rest.

---

### Resources Beyond This Guide

**READ COMICS:**
Best research is reading source material.

---

### Campaign Longevity

**SHORT CAMPAIGN (1-10 sessions):**
- One major arc
- Clear ending
- Tight focus
- Good for beginners

**MEDIUM CAMPAIGN (11-30 sessions):**
- 2-4 major arcs
- Character development
- Ongoing threats
- Most campaigns

**LONG CAMPAIGN (31+ sessions):**
- Epic scope
- Multiple arcs
- Character growth
- Rare but rewarding

**KNOW WHEN TO END:**
- Better to end strong than drag on
- Leave wanting more
- Epilogues are satisfying
- Can always start new campaign in same world

---

### Your Campaign Is Unique

**This guide gives tools and advice. But:**
- Your table is different
- Your players are unique
- Your story is yours

**Use what works. Ignore what doesn't.**

**The goal is fun. If everyone's having fun, you're doing it right.**

---

## FINAL WORDS

Being a GM is hard work. You're creating worlds, voicing dozens of characters, adjudicating rules, managing personalities, and trying to tell a compelling story.

**But it's also incredibly rewarding.**

When your players gasp at a twist, when they laugh at your NPC's joke, when they talk excitedly about what happened - those moments make it worth it.

You're giving your friends stories they'll remember for years. That's pretty amazing.

So go forth. Create worlds. Challenge heroes. Tell stories.

And most importantly: **Have fun.**

Because at the end of the day, that's what this is all about.
