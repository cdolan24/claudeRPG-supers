# COMPLETE EQUIPMENT & WEAPONS v4.0

---

## EQUIPMENT PHILOSOPHY

Equipment represents gear your character carries that isn't part of their innate abilities. Most superheroes don't need much equipment, but some (like Batman or Punisher) rely heavily on their gear.

**Important Notes:**
- Equipment can be lost, stolen, or destroyed
- Advantages (like Flight or Natural Weapons) cannot be taken away
- Some "equipment" is better represented as advantages (Iron Man's armor = Gadgeteer class + advantages)
- Starting wealth depends on Origin (see Character Creation guide)

---

## STARTING WEALTH BY ORIGIN

Your origin determines starting resources:

| Origin | Starting Wealth | Notes |
|--------|----------------|-------|
| Experiment | 1000 credits | Government/corporate compensation |
| Alien | 500 credits | Unfamiliar with Earth economy |
| Mutant | 1000 credits | Normal upbringing |
| Training | 1500 credits | Professional income |
| Gadgeteer | 3000 credits | Tech resources |
| Mystic | 500 credits | Material wealth unimportant |
| Accident | 800 credits | Average savings |
| Divine | 500 credits | Don't need money |

**Credit System:** 1 credit ≈ $1 USD in purchasing power
