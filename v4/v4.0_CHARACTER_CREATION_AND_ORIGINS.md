# CHARACTER CREATION GUIDE & ORIGINS v4.0

---

## CHARACTER CREATION STEPS

Follow these steps to create your superhero character:

### STEP 1: CONCEPT
**Ask yourself:**
- What kind of hero do I want to play?
- What are their powers?
- What's their personality?
- Why did they become a hero?

**Examples:**
- "I want to play a tech genius in powered armor" → Gadgeteer (Armorer)
- "I want to be a super-strong flying hero" → Paragon (Champion)
- "I want to control fire and lightning" → Conduit (Fire/Lightning)
- "I want to be a shapeshifting spy" → Trickster (Shapeshifter)

### STEP 2: CHOOSE ORIGIN
Pick one Origin that explains how you got your powers. This determines:
- Starting wealth
- Background story elements
- Sometimes starting advantages
- Optional disadvantages

**See full Origins list below**

### STEP 3: CHOOSE CLASS
Select your primary class based on your concept.
- **Paragon:** Flying brick, inspirational leader
- **Juggernaut:** Unstoppable tank
- **Gadgeteer:** Tech genius
- **Mystic:** Magic user
- **Martial Artist:** Peak human fighter
- **Speedster:** Super speed
- **Metamorph:** Shapeshifter
- **Mentalist:** Psychic
- **Conduit:** Elemental controller
- **Trickster:** Deception specialist

**See Complete Classes document for details**

### STEP 4: DETERMINE ABILITY SCORES
You have **three methods** to choose from:

**METHOD 1: Standard Array**
- Assign these scores to your six abilities: 15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8
- Simple and balanced

**METHOD 2: Point Buy (27 points)**
- All abilities start at 8
- Spend points to increase:
  - 9 costs 1 point
  - 10 costs 2 points
  - 11 costs 3 points
  - 12 costs 4 points
  - 13 costs 5 points
  - 14 costs 7 points
  - 15 costs 9 points
- Maximum 15 before racial/class bonuses
- Most customizable

**METHOD 3: Roll (4d6 drop lowest, six times)**
- Roll 4d6, drop the lowest die, sum the other three
- Do this six times
- Assign the six results to your abilities
- Most random, can be very powerful or very weak
- **Optional rule:** GM may allow reroll if total < 70 or highest < 14

**Ability Recommendations by Class:**
| Class | Primary | Secondary | Tertiary |
|-------|---------|-----------|----------|
| Paragon | STR, CHA | CON | DEX, WIS |
| Juggernaut | STR, CON | - | WIS |
| Gadgeteer | INT | DEX | CON, WIS |

| Metamorph | CON | DEX, WIS | STR |
| Mentalist | INT, WIS | CHA | CON |
| Conduit | CON | WIS, CHA | STR, DEX |
| Trickster | DEX | CHA, INT | WIS |

### STEP 5: CALCULATE STARTING HIT POINTS
**HP at 1st Level:**
- Hit Die maximum + CON modifier + 10
- Example: Paragon (d12) with CON 14 (+2) = 12 + 2 + 10 = **24 HP**

**HP Calculation Formula:** Max HD + CON mod + 10

### STEP 6: CHOOSE SKILLS
Your class determines how many skill proficiencies you get and which skills are available.

**Proficiency Bonus:** +2 at 1st level
- When proficient in skill: Roll d20 + ability modifier + proficiency bonus
- When not proficient: Roll d20 + ability modifier

**See Skills List document for complete descriptions**

### STEP 7: RECORD CLASS FEATURES
Write down all features your class grants at 1st level:
- Starting package advantages
- Class feature (e.g., Paragon's Inspiring Presence)
- Saving throw proficiencies
- Weapon/armor proficiencies

### STEP 8: CHOOSE STARTING EQUIPMENT
You get starting wealth based on your Origin (see Origins list below).

**Two Options:**
1. **Buy equipment** using your starting credits (see Equipment document)
2. **Take starting package** (GM provides appropriate gear for your concept)

**Typical Starting Package:**
- One weapon (martial or simple depending on class)
- Appropriate armor (light, medium, or heavy based on proficiency)
- Basic adventuring gear (backpack, rope, flashlight, etc.)
- Personal items (smartphone, civilian clothes, etc.)
- 2d6 × 10 credits remaining

### STEP 9: SPEND CHARACTER POINTS (CP)
**You have CP to spend on advantages:**
- **Starting CP:** 50 CP (from class starting package) + 50 CP (base) = **100 CP total at 1st level**
- **You can gain additional CP** by taking disadvantages (max -80 CP recommended)

**CP Spending Priority:**
1. Buy advantages that define your core powers (flight, super strength, energy blasts, etc.)
2. Consider defensive advantages (DR, force field, regeneration)
3. Enhance abilities (Enhanced STR, DEX, etc.)
4. Add utility advantages (special senses, movement, etc.)

**CP Recommendations:**
- **Focused Build:** Spend heavily in 2-3 key advantages (Superman: Enhanced STR, Flight, DR)
- **Versatile Build:** Spread CP across 5-6 moderate advantages (Batman: Gadgets, skills, tactics)
- **Specialized Build:** Max out one thing (Flash: ALL speed advantages)

**See Complete Advantages document for options**

### STEP 10: SELECT DISADVANTAGES (Optional)
Choose disadvantages to gain additional CP (up to -80 CP recommended).

**Good Disadvantages:**
- Add character depth (PTSD, Code of Honor, Obsession)
- Create interesting roleplay (Secret Identity, Dependents)
- Balance powerful builds (Vulnerabilities, Power Limitations)

**Avoid:**
- Disadvantages that won't matter in your campaign
- Disadvantages that make character unplayable
- Disadvantages you'll ignore/violate constantly

**See Complete Disadvantages document for options**

### STEP 11: CHOOSE ARCHETYPE (At 3rd Level)
You choose your subclass at 3rd level, not 1st level. This gives you time to learn your character before specializing.

### STEP 12: FINAL DETAILS
**Determine:**
- **Armor Class (AC):** 10 + DEX modifier + armor bonus + shield bonus + other bonuses
- **Initiative:** DEX modifier + bonuses
- **Speed:** Base 30 ft (human) + modifications
- **Attack Bonuses:**
  - Melee: STR modifier + proficiency (if proficient)
  - Ranged: DEX modifier + proficiency (if proficient)
  - Powers: Varies by advantage

**Create:**
- **Hero Name:** Your superhero identity

Work with your GM to create a custom origin or blend elements from multiple origins. Origins are story frameworks, not rigid rules.

**Do origins give mechanical benefits?**
Some do (suggestions listed), but primarily they provide:
- Starting wealth
- Story hooks and roleplay opportunities
