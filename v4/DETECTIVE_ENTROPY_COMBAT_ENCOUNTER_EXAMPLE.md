## THE ENCOUNTER: "Nightclub Decay"

### SETUP

**Location:** The Velvet Void - abandoned nightclub in warehouse district

**Situation:** Detective Entropy has been tracking a serial killer who murders victims and leaves no evidence. He discovered the killer uses a mystical artifact to erase their victims from reality retroactively - they never existed, so no crime occurred. Tonight, the killer has struck again at this nightclub. Three victims are dead (or were they ever alive?). Reality is unstable here.

**Enemies:**
- **The Eraser** (main villain) - Reality Warper
- **4 Temporal Thugs** - minions who exist in multiple timelines simultaneously

**Entropy's Goal:** Stop the killer, reconstruct crime scene, ensure justice for victims who reality says never existed

## ROUND-BY-ROUND COMBAT

---

### INITIATIVE

*Everyone rolls Initiative (d20 + DEX modifier)*

**Results:**
- **Entropy:** 21 (rolled 17 + 4 DEX)
- **Temporal Thugs:** 19 (rolled 16 + 3, they go together)
- **The Eraser:** 12 (rolled 10 + 2)

**Turn Order:** Entropy → Thugs → Eraser

---

## ROUND 1

---

### ENTROPY'S TURN (Initiative 21)

*Detective Entropy steps into the nightclub. The strobe lights flicker, but around him, they decay - bulbs burning out in his presence. His voice is flat, cosmic, inevitable.*

**ENTROPY:** "The case is closed before it opens. Entropy always wins. You're just... accelerating the timeline."

*He surveys the scene with eyes that see decay rates of all matter. The walls are crumbling faster than they should. The bodies on the floor (three of them) are decomposing wrong - they're fading from reality, not rotting.*

**Analysis (Free Action):**
- Entropy uses passive Perception (20) and passive Investigation (21)
- Notices: Bodies are being erased retroactively, reality is unstable, The Eraser holds glowing artifact

**ACTION: Temporal Decay on nearest corpse**
*Entropy kneels by the first body - a young woman in club attire. He doesn't touch her (would decay her further). Instead, he focuses on the space around her, rewinding local time.*

**MECHANIC:**
- Uses Temporal Decay ability (1/3 uses today)
- Target: Corpse #1
- Range: 30 ft (she's 15 ft away)
- Effect: Rewind time around corpse by 8 hours (1 hour per level)
- Concentration required (up to 10 minutes)

**RESULT:**
*Like watching a film in reverse, the scene reconstructs itself. The woman appears - no longer dead, but a "ghost" of past events. She's dancing, laughing. Then The Eraser approaches. The artifact glows. She screams silently. She fades. Reality forgets her.*

**ENTROPY (TO HIMSELF):** "Interesting. He doesn't kill them. He unmakes them. They never existed. Retroactive entropy. Almost elegant."

**BONUS ACTION: Cunning Action - Hide**
*Entropy steps behind the bar (20 ft movement), using Cunning Action to Hide.*

**MECHANIC:**
- Bonus Action (Cunning Action class feature)
- Movement: 20 ft to bar
- Stealth check: 1d20 + 10 (expertise) = 24 (rolled 14 + 10)
- Bar provides half cover
- Dim lighting gives advantage (Shadow Dancer archetype)
- He's effectively invisible to thugs

**ENTROPY (NARRATING TO HIMSELF LIKE NOIR DETECTIVE):**
*"Four temporal anomalies between me and the perp. They exist in multiple timelines - smart. But timelines all converge to heat death. I am the convergence point."*

---

### TEMPORAL THUGS' TURN (Initiative 19)

**THUG 1 & 2 (Near Bar):**
*They see Entropy disappear behind bar. They're not sophisticated - just enforcers who happen to phase through timelines.*

**THUG 1:** "He's behind the bar! Get him!"

**ACTION: Ready Attack**
- Thug 1 & 2 move toward bar (30 ft movement each)
- Ready action: Attack if Entropy shows himself
- They're now 5 ft from bar (melee range if Entropy emerges)

**THUG 3 & 4 (Dance Floor):**
*They circle toward the bar from the other side, trying to flank.*

**ACTION: Move**
- Both move 30 ft toward bar from opposite direction
- Attempting to surround Entropy's position
- Now 10 ft from bar (will reach next turn)

**THUG 3:** "He can't hide forever! We've seen every timeline - he dies in all of them!"

**ENTROPY (MUTTERED FROM HIDING):** "Incorrect. In all timelines, YOU cease to exist. I'm just the courier delivering the inevitable message."

---

### THE ERASER'S TURN (Initiative 12)

*The Eraser, a gaunt man in expensive suit holding a glowing crystal that warps reality around it, stands in VIP section. He seems unconcerned.*

**THE ERASER:** "Detective. You're investigating murders that never happened. Victims who never existed. What's the crime?"

**ACTION: Erase Evidence**
*The Eraser raises the artifact. Reality ripples. The three corpses begin to fade more rapidly.*

**MECHANIC:**
- Ability: Erase Evidence (recharge 5-6 on d6)
- Range: 30 ft radius centered on self
- Effect: All physical evidence of crime within radius begins to disappear
- Duration: Permanent unless countered

**RESULT:**
- Corpses fade more: 50% transparent now
- Blood stains vanish
- Broken furniture repairs itself
- Signs of struggle disappearing

**ENTROPY'S CONCENTRATION CHECK:**
*Entropy is still concentrating on Temporal Decay on Corpse #1. Does this break concentration?*

**DM RULING:** 
- Entropy's ability is local to the corpse (30 ft range, effect is on corpse)
- Eraser's ability is trying to erase the corpse
- Contest: Entropy's spell save DC (8 + 3 prof + 5 INT = 16) vs Eraser's ability DC (15)
- Entropy's ability wins - the temporal reconstruction holds, but just barely
- Corpse #1 stays visible in "time rewind" - she's fighting the erasure

**THE ERASER (FRUSTRATED):** "You're preserving evidence that shouldn't exist. You're breaking causality."

**ENTROPY:** "I am causality. All things decay to their conclusion. I'm just... reading the footnotes."

**LEGENDARY ACTION (1):**
*The Eraser uses legendary action to move 15 ft toward better vantage point of bar*

---

## ROUND 2

---

### ENTROPY'S TURN (Initiative 21)

*Entropy maintains concentration on the temporal reconstruction while analyzing enemy positions. Four thugs converging on his location. The Eraser 40 ft away, elevated.*

**ENTROPY (THINKING):**
*"Four probability waves. One certainty. Classic efficiency problem. Solve for the constant - remove the source."*

**ANALYSIS:**
- Thugs are 5-10 ft away (converging)
- Eraser is 40 ft away, elevated
- If Entropy engages thugs, Eraser will escape or erase more evidence
- Need to neutralize Eraser first

**DECISION: Shadow Dancer Teleport**

*Entropy drops concentration on Temporal Decay (he's seen what he needed - the murder). The "ghost" of the victim fades. But he remembers. Entropy always remembers - he is the universe's final memory.*

**FREE ACTION: Drop Concentration**
- Temporal Decay ends
- Corpse fully fades (Eraser's erasure takes effect)
- But Entropy has the memory locked in his perfect mind

**BONUS ACTION: Shadow Dancer Teleport**
*Entropy's form dissolves into decay particles - molecules falling apart, entropy personified. He reappears 30 ft away, directly behind The Eraser in VIP section.*

**MECHANIC:**
- Class Feature: Shadow Dancer (Trickster 3)
- Bonus Action, 30 ft teleport to unoccupied space
- Uses: 2/short rest (1 remaining)
- Appears in VIP section, 5 ft behind Eraser

**APPEARANCE:**
*For a moment, The Eraser sees what Entropy truly is - the heat death of the universe, the final silence, the last star going dark. Then he's just a man in a trench coat again. But the terror remains.*

**ENTROPY:** "Everyone talks about the end of the world. I AM the end. And you've committed murder in my presence. How... temporary of you."

**ACTION: Decay Touch**
*Entropy reaches out with one hand. Where his fingers extend, reality itself seems to crumble. Age accelerates. Time becomes visible as a degrading film reel.*

**MECHANIC:**
- Advantage on attack (The Eraser is surprised by teleport - DM ruling)
- Attack roll: 1d20 + 7 (4 DEX + 3 prof) with advantage
- Roll 1: 15 + 7 = 22
- Roll 2: 8 + 7 = 15
- Takes higher: 22
- Eraser's AC: 16
- **HIT!**

**DAMAGE:**
- Decay Touch: 3d10 necrotic damage
- Sneak Attack: 4d6 (Eraser hasn't acted against Entropy yet this turn)
- Roll 3d10: 7 + 8 + 6 = 21 necrotic
- Roll 4d6: 4 + 5 + 2 + 6 = 17 extra
- **TOTAL: 38 damage**

**DESCRIPTION:**
*Entropy's hand brushes The Eraser's shoulder. The expensive suit ages instantly - silk becoming threadbare, then moth-eaten, then dust. The flesh beneath withers. Skin wrinkles, hair grays, bone becomes brittle. The Eraser screams.*

**THE ERASER:** "AAAGH! What ARE you?!"

**ENTROPY:** "I am the last thing in the universe. The final thought before silence. You wanted to erase people from existence? I erase existence itself. Eventually."

**ERASER'S HP:** 90 → 52 HP remaining

---

### TEMPORAL THUGS' TURN (Initiative 19)

**THUG 1 & 2 (At Bar):**
*They realize Entropy is no longer behind bar. They look around confused.*

**THUG 1:** "Where'd he—"

**THUG 2 (POINTING):** "VIP section! He's got the boss!"

**ACTION: Move + Dash**
- Both use Dash action (move + action = 60 ft total)
- Run toward VIP section stairs
- Thugs are fast but VIP section is 40 ft away + 5 ft up stairs
- They reach base of stairs (will be able to attack next turn)

**THUG 3 & 4 (Dance Floor):**
*Also see Entropy teleport. They split up - tactical.*

**THUG 3:**
- Moves 30 ft toward VIP section
- Reaches stairs, climbs (stairs cost extra movement)
- Arrives at top of VIP section, 10 ft from Entropy

**ACTION: Attack with bat**
- Attack roll: 1d20 + 5 = 19 (rolled 14 + 5)
- Entropy's AC: 16
- **HIT!**

**DAMAGE:**
- 1d8 + 3 = 7 bludgeoning (rolled 4 + 3)

**ENTROPY'S REACTION: Uncanny Dodge**
*Entropy sees the bat coming - of course he does. He sees ALL things coming. The bat swings through space-time, but entropy is patient. He shifts slightly. The bat still connects, but wrong angle, wrong timing.*

**MECHANIC:**
- Class Feature: Uncanny Dodge (Trickster 5)
- Reaction: Halve damage from one attack you can see
- 7 damage → 3 damage
- **Entropy takes 3 bludgeoning damage**

**ENTROPY'S HP:** 52 → 49 HP

**ENTROPY (NOT EVEN LOOKING AT THUG):** "You're swinging at inevitability. Statistically inefficient."

**THUG 4:**
- Moves 30 ft to flank but can't reach VIP section this turn
- Readies action to attack next turn

---

### THE ERASER'S TURN (Initiative 12)

*The Eraser stumbles back from Entropy's touch, clutching his withered shoulder. He's terrified but desperate.*

**THE ERASER:** "You're not human! You can't be—"

**ENTROPY:** "Correct. I'm the universe's closing statement. You're just... punctuation."

**ACTION: Reality Erasure Ray**
*The Eraser points the artifact at Entropy. Reality warps. A beam of un-light shoots out - not darkness, but the absence of existence itself.*

**MECHANIC:**
- Attack: Reality Erasure Ray
- Attack roll: 1d20 + 6 = 18 (rolled 12 + 6)
- Entropy's AC: 16
- **HIT!**

**DAMAGE:**
- 3d8 force damage: 6 + 7 + 4 = 17 force damage
- **Entropy takes 17 force damage**

**ENTROPY'S HP:** 49 → 32 HP

**SECONDARY EFFECT:**
- Entropy must make WIS save DC 15 or be "forgotten" by Thugs
- Entropy's WIS save: 1d20 + 4 WIS = 19 (rolled 15 + 4)
- **SUCCESS** - Entropy's cosmic importance resists being forgotten

**ENTROPY (STAGGERED BUT STANDING):**
*The beam passes through him. For a moment, he flickers - like reality itself isn't sure he exists. But he solidifies. You cannot erase entropy. Entropy is the default state.*

**ENTROPY:** "Interesting. You tried to erase me from causality. But causality ends with me. Paradox."

**THE ERASER (BACKING AWAY):** "Stay back!"

**LEGENDARY ACTION (1): Temporal Shift**
*The Eraser uses legendary action to teleport 30 ft away from Entropy, to far corner of VIP section*

---

## ROUND 3

---

### ENTROPY'S TURN (Initiative 21)

*Entropy is bloodied (32/52 HP), surrounded by temporal thugs, and his target just teleported away. But he's not human. He doesn't panic. Panic is entropy of the mind - and he IS entropy.*

**ENTROPY (ANALYZING):**
*"The artifact is the source. Destroy the artifact, the ability ends. Eraser is mortal beneath the cosmic theft. Thugs are irrelevant - timeline probability waves collapse when observed. I am observation."*

**STRATEGY:**
- Eraser is 30 ft away (far corner of VIP section)
- 3 thugs are in melee range or will be next turn
- Need to end this - evidence fading rapidly

**ACTION: DECAY TOUCH ON THE ARTIFACT**
*Entropy doesn't attack the Eraser. He attacks the ARTIFACT the Eraser is holding.*

**ENTROPY:** "The crime isn't the murder. The crime is theft. You stole finality from your victims. I'm repossessing it."

**MECHANIC:**
- Called shot at artifact (DM ruling: -2 to attack roll, but Entropy has advantage from clever tactic)
- Attack roll: 1d20 + 5 (7 - 2 for called shot) with advantage
- Roll 1: 18 + 5 = 23
- Roll 2: 11 + 5 = 16
- Takes higher: 23
- **HIT THE ARTIFACT!**

**BUT FIRST - MOVEMENT:**
*Entropy must reach the Eraser (30 ft away). He uses his 30 ft movement to walk toward him. Not run. Walk. Inevitable. Slow. Like continental drift, like the expansion of the universe, like the approach of the final dark.*

**MOVEMENT:** 30 ft walk toward Eraser (now 5 ft away, melee range)

**THUGS GET OPPORTUNITY ATTACKS:**
- Thug 3 (in melee) gets opportunity attack as Entropy walks past
- Attack roll: 1d20 + 5 = 12 (rolled 7 + 5)
- Entropy's AC: 16
- **MISS** - The bat swings where Entropy was, not where he is

**DECAY TOUCH HITS ARTIFACT:**
*Entropy's fingers touch the glowing crystal. Time stops. Everyone in the room feels it - the weight of eternity, the approach of ending, the final silence.*

**EFFECT:**
- Artifact is reality-warping item: Very high HP, but Decay Touch ignores HP
- Roll for artifact save: CON save (artifacts use CON or construct rules)
- Artifact CON save: +5 (powerful artifact)
- DC: 8 + 3 prof + 5 INT = 16
- Roll: 1d20 + 5 = 11 (rolled 6 + 5)
- **FAIL** - Artifact begins to decay

**DAMAGE TO ARTIFACT:**
- 3d10 necrotic: 9 + 7 + 8 = 24 damage
- Artifact cracks, spiderwebbing with age
- Glowing dims

**DESCRIPTION:**
*The crystal ages. Cracks appear - not from impact, but from TIME. It's ancient suddenly, weathered by eons in an instant. The glow flickers like a dying star.*

**THE ERASER:** "NO! Do you know what you've done?!"

**ENTROPY:** "Yes. Always. I know all endings. This is yours."

**BONUS ACTION: Cunning Action - Disengage**
*Entropy steps back 10 ft using Cunning Action to Disengage (no opportunity attacks)*

---

### TEMPORAL THUGS' TURN (Initiative 19)

**ALL 4 THUGS:**
*They converge on Entropy in VIP section. All attack.*

**THUG 1:** Attack roll 1d20 + 5 = 16 (rolled 11 + 5) - HITS AC 16!
- Damage: 1d8 + 3 = 7 (rolled 4 + 3)
- **Entropy takes 7 damage**

**THUG 2:** Attack roll 1d20 + 5 = 11 (rolled 6 + 5) - MISSES AC 16

**THUG 3:** Attack roll 1d20 + 5 = 23 (rolled 18 + 5) - HIT!
- Damage: 1d8 + 3 = 9 (rolled 6 + 3)
- **Entropy takes 9 damage**

**THUG 4:** Attack roll 1d20 + 5 = 14 (rolled 9 + 5) - MISSES AC 16

**TOTAL DAMAGE:** 16 damage to Entropy

**ENTROPY'S HP:** 32 → 16 HP (Bloodied badly)

**ENTROPY (STAGGERED, BUT VOICE STILL FLAT):**
*"Pain is temporary. Entropy is forever. You do the math."*

---

### THE ERASER'S TURN (Initiative 12)

*The Eraser looks at his cracking artifact in horror. Then at Entropy. Then makes a decision.*

**THE ERASER:** "If I'm going down, I'm taking you with me!"

**ACTION: ARTIFACT OVERLOAD**
*The Eraser channels all remaining power from the artifact into one final Reality Erasure Ray - at the cost of destroying the artifact completely.*

**MECHANIC:**
- Special ability: Artifact Overload
- Effect: 6d8 force damage in 15 ft cone
- All creatures in cone make WIS save DC 17 or be "forgotten" by reality for 1 minute
- After this, artifact shatters completely
- Targets: Entropy + Thug 3 (both in cone)

**THE ERASER SHOUTS:**
"BE FORGOTTEN!"

**ENTROPY'S SAVES:**

**DEX Save for Damage:**
- Evasion feature (Trickster 7): DEX save for half damage = no damage; failed = half
- DEX save: 1d20 + 7 = 24 (rolled 17 + 7)
- **SUCCESS** - Evasion means NO DAMAGE!

**WIS Save for "Forgotten" Effect:**
- WIS save: 1d20 + 4 = 18 (rolled 14 + 4)
- DC: 17
- **SUCCESS** - Not forgotten!

**ENTROPY'S DEFENSE:**
*The beam of un-existence washes over Entropy. But Entropy is the END of existence. You cannot erase what everything becomes. The beam dissipates around him like water around a stone.*

**ENTROPY:** "You cannot erase entropy. Entropy is what's LEFT when everything else is erased."

**THUG 3 (Less Lucky):**
- DEX save: Failed - Takes 25 force damage (rolled 3d8+3d8 = 25)
- HP: 22 → 0 HP - **DISINTEGRATED**
- Thug 3 is erased from reality completely

**THE ARTIFACT:**
*The crystal shatters. Reality snaps back like a rubber band. The three murdered victims suddenly RE-EXIST - their corpses appear on the dance floor. They were always dead. But now reality remembers them.*

**ENTROPY (SEEING THE CORPSES REAPPEAR):**
"There they are. Always were. Just needed causality to... align."

**THE ERASER (STARING AT BROKEN ARTIFACT):**
"No... no... it's gone... my power..."

---

## ROUND 4 - FINAL ROUND

---

### ENTROPY'S TURN (Initiative 21)

*Entropy is at 16/52 HP. Badly wounded. Three thugs still standing. The Eraser powerless but dangerous. The case is solved - victims exist, evidence exists, killer is confirmed. Now just... cleanup.*

**ENTROPY (TO THE ERASER):**
"Case closed. Three counts of murder. Three corpses. One murderer. One inevitable ending. The math is elegant."

**ACTION: Decay Touch on The Eraser**
*Entropy walks forward (5 ft movement). Reaches out one hand.*

**ATTACK:**
- Attack roll with advantage (Eraser is helpless, no artifact): 1d20 + 7
- Roll 1: 19 + 7 = 26
- Roll 2: 14 + 7 = 21
- **CRITICAL HIT! (Natural 19 with advantage)**

**DAMAGE:**
- Decay Touch: 3d10 × 2 (crit) = 6d10 necrotic
- Sneak Attack: 4d6 × 2 (crit) = 8d6 extra
- Roll 6d10: 7+9+4+8+6+5 = 39 necrotic
- Roll 8d6: 5+4+6+3+2+4+5+6 = 35 extra
- **TOTAL: 74 damage**

**THE ERASER'S HP:** 52 → -22 HP

**THE ERASER IS DEAD.**

**DESCRIPTION:**
*Entropy touches The Eraser's chest. The decay is instantaneous and total. Skin withers. Muscle desiccates. Bone becomes dust. In three seconds, The Eraser ages a thousand years. He doesn't scream - he doesn't have time. He simply... ends.*

*When Entropy pulls his hand back, there's only a suit full of dust. The dust settles to the floor. Entropy pulls out his notebook, writes:*

**ENTROPY (WRITING):**
"Cause of death: Acceleration of natural processes. Time of death: Inevitable. Case status: Closed."

**TO THE REMAINING THUGS:**
*Entropy turns to face the three remaining Temporal Thugs. His eyes are tired - not from combat, but from existing. Always existing. Forever existing.*

**ENTROPY:**
"Your employer has reached his final state. You are probability waves that have collapsed. Schrödinger's thugs. I recommend... dissipating."

**INTIMIDATION CHECK:**
- Charisma is only +1, but context matters
- They just watched him unmake their boss
- He's cosmic entropy personified
- Roll: 1d20 + 1 = 18 (rolled 17 + 1)
- DC: 15 (thugs aren't that brave)
- **SUCCESS**

**THUGS 1, 2, and 4:**
*They drop their bats. Back away slowly. Then run - phasing through multiple timelines simultaneously in their panic to LEAVE.*

**THUG 2 (FLEEING):**
"He's not human! He's not—"

*They're gone. Entropy doesn't pursue. Pursuit implies caring about the outcome. He doesn't. They'll die eventually anyway. Everyone does.*

---

## AFTERMATH

*Detective Entropy stands alone in the nightclub. Three corpses are on the floor - real now, remembered by reality. A suit full of dust that was once The Eraser. The case is solved.*

**ENTROPY (PULLING OUT FLASK, TAKING A DRINK):**
*The whiskey is perfect. It's been the same temperature, the same taste, the same molecular structure for decades. He preserved it. The one thing he keeps.*

**ENTROPY (TO THE CORPSES):**
"You exist now. That's... something. Not much. But something. You were forgotten. I remembered you. That's what I do. I remember everything. Until the final dark."

*He pulls out his phone (somehow it works despite his presence degrading all technology). Dials police.*

**ENTROPY (FLAT VOICE):**
"Detective Entropy. I have three bodies, one suspect deceased, location The Velvet Void nightclub, warehouse district. Cause of death for suspect: Natural causes. Very... accelerated natural causes."

*He hangs up. Sits at the bar. Waits. Police will arrive in 10 minutes.*

**ENTROPY (MONOLOGUE):**
*"Another case. Another ending. I'm good at endings. Should be. I am one. THE one. The final thought before silence. Until then... I solve crimes. Because if nothing matters, everything matters. Paradox. I hate paradoxes. No I don't. I am one."*

*He drinks his eternal whiskey. The strobe lights finally die around him. The darkness is comfortable. Darkness is just entropy with better PR.*

## COMBAT ANALYSIS

### ENTROPY'S TACTICAL DECISIONS:

**ROUND 1:**
- Used Temporal Decay to reconstruct crime (investigation first)
- Cunning Action to hide (Trickster mobility)
- Avoided direct confrontation (smart - outnumbered)

**ROUND 2:**
- Shadow Dancer teleport directly to boss (eliminate source)
- Decay Touch + Sneak Attack (38 damage) - massive alpha strike
- Accepted hits from thugs (calculated risk)

**ROUND 3:**
- Called shot to artifact (end power source, not just wound enemy)
- Walked slowly (intimidation through inevitability)
- Cunning Action to Disengage (positioning)
- Took damage from thugs (16 HP) - survivable

**ROUND 4:**
- Final Decay Touch on Eraser (critical hit, 74 damage)
- Intimidation to end combat non-violently with remaining thugs

### MECHANICAL FEATURES USED:

**FROM TRICKSTER CLASS:**
- Sneak Attack (4d6 extra damage when conditions met)
- Cunning Action (bonus action mobility)
- Uncanny Dodge (halve one attack's damage)
- Evasion (DEX save for half = no damage)
- Expertise (Investigation to analyze scene)
- Shadow Dancer teleport (30 ft bonus action)

**FROM ORIGIN:**
- Temporal Decay (reconstruct crime scene)
- Decay Touch (3d10 necrotic melee attack)
- Cosmic awareness (analysis of situation)
- Cannot be forgotten (resisted erasure)

**FROM STATS:**
- High INT (+5) for investigation and spell DC
- High WIS (+4) for perception and saves
- High DEX (+4) for AC, initiative, stealth

### DAMAGE TAKEN:
- Round 1: 0 (hidden)
- Round 2: 3 + 17 = 20 damage
- Round 3: 16 damage
- Total: 36 damage taken
- Final HP: 16/52 (31% remaining)

### DAMAGE DEALT:
- Round 2: 38 to Eraser
- Round 3: 24 to artifact
- Round 4: 74 to Eraser (overkill by 22)
- Total: 136 damage dealt

## CHARACTER CONCLUSIONS

**WHY THIS WORKS:**

**1. TRICKSTER CLASS ≠ "ROGUE WITH POWERS"**
- Investigation focus fits detective
- Mobility (Cunning Action, teleport) fits cosmic being
- Evasion fits "entropy can't be stopped"
- Sneak Attack represents precision, not backstabbing

**2. ONE-OF-A-KIND ORIGIN PROVIDES UNIQUE FLAVOR**
- Decay powers make sense (entropy themed)
- Cosmic awareness aids investigation
- Can't be erased (narrative protection)
- Provides disadvantages (everything dies, can't relate)

**3. UNUSUAL COMBO CREATES MEMORABLE CHARACTER**
- Not "powerful" in traditional sense (16 HP at encounter end)
- Not optimized for combat (CHA only +1)
- Relies on tactics, positioning, and clever use of abilities
- Roleplay opportunities constant (cosmic perspective vs mundane crimes)

**4. COMBAT IS PUZZLE-SOLVING**
- Didn't just "fight" - investigated during combat
- Used Temporal Decay first (gather evidence)
- Targeted artifact, not just enemy
- Ended combat through intimidation, not murder

**5. CHARACTER PERSONALITY SHINES IN MECHANICS**
- Flat, noir narration reflects cosmic detachment
- Walks slowly (inevitability) = movement choices
- Doesn't dodge frantically (Uncanny Dodge = reality shift)
- Drinks eternal whiskey (small preservation in sea of decay)

## FINAL THOUGHTS

**Detective Entropy works because:**
- Origin provides story hook (cosmic entity solving crimes)
- Class provides mechanics (investigation + combat capability)
- Unusual combo creates unique playstyle (detective-noir-cosmic-horror)
- High INT/WIS supports investigation
- DEX supports Trickster
- Decay powers support theme
- Disadvantages create roleplay tension

**In combat, he's:**
- Mobile (teleport, Cunning Action)
- Tactical (analyze, position, strike)
- Survivable (Evasion, Uncanny Dodge, high AC)
- Deadly (Decay Touch + Sneak Attack)
- Thematic (entropy aesthetic in all actions)

**Out of combat, he's:**
- Investigator (Expertise in Investigation, Temporal Decay)
- Noir detective (personality, monologues)
- Cosmic horror (people fear him)
- Philosophical (questions meaning of justice when everything ends)

The character concept that "doesn't make sense" (cosmic entity as detective) works PERFECTLY because the system supports any Origin + Class combination through CP customization and clever use of class features.

*"In the end, all cases close. All criminals face justice. All victims are remembered. Not because of morality. Because entropy demands accounting. I am the accountant of the universe's final ledger."*
